abstract = {Difficulties in scaling up theoretical and experimental results have raised controversy over the consequences of biodiversity loss for the functioning of natural ecosystems. Using a global survey of reef fish assemblages, we show that in contrast to previous theoretical and experimental studies, ecosystem functioning (as measured by standing biomass) scales in a non-saturating manner with biodiversity (as measured by species and functional richness) in this ecosystem. Our field study also shows a significant and negative interaction between human population density and biodiversity on ecosystem functioning (i.e., for the same human density there were larger reductions in standing biomass at more diverse reefs). Human effects were found to be related to fishing, coastal development, and land use stressors, and currently affect over 75% of the world's coral reefs. Our results indicate that the consequences of biodiversity loss in coral reefs have been considerably underestimated based on existing knowledge and that reef fish assemblages, particularly the most diverse, are greatly vulnerable to the expansion and intensity of anthropogenic stressors in coastal areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Mora et al.},

abstract = {Abstract. Ocean acidification is projected to shift coral reefs from a state of net accretion to one of net dissolution this century. Presently, our ability to predict global-scale changes to coral reef calcification is limited by insufficient data relating seawater carbonate chemistry parameters to in situ rates of reef calcification. Here, we investigate diel and seasonal trends in carbonate chemistry of the Davies Reef flat in the central Great Barrier Reef and relate these trends to benthic carbon fluxes by quantifying net ecosystem calcification (nec) and net community production (ncp). Results show that seawater carbonate chemistry of the Davies Reef flat is highly variable over both diel and seasonal cycles. pH (total scale) ranged from 7.92 to 8.17, pCO2 ranged from 272 to 542 $\mu$atm, and aragonite saturation state ($\Omega$arag) ranged from 2.9 to 4.1. Diel cycles in carbonate chemistry were primarily driven by ncp, and warming explained 35% and 47% of the seasonal shifts in pCO2 and pH, respectively. Daytime ncp averaged 37 ± 19 mmol C m−2 h−1 in summer and 33 ± 13 mmol C m−2 h−1 in winter; nighttime ncp averaged −30 ± 25 and −7 ± 6 mmol C m−2 h−1 in summer and winter, respectively. Daytime nec averaged 11 ± 4 mmol CaCO3 m−2 h−1 in summer and 8 ± 3 mmol CaCO3 m−2 h−1 in winter, whereas nighttime nec averaged 2 ± 4 mmol and −1 ± 3 mmol CaCO3 m−2 h−1 in summer and winter, respectively. Net ecosystem calcification was highly sensitive to changes in $\Omega$arag for both seasons, indicating that relatively small shifts in $\Omega$arag may drive measurable shifts in calcification rates, and hence carbon budgets, of coral reefs throughout the year.},

abstract = {The term beta diversity has been used to refer to a wide variety of phenomena. Although all of these encompass some kind of compositional heterogeneity between places, many are not related to each other in any predictable way. The present two-part review aims to put the different phenomena that have been called beta diversity into a common conceptual framework, and to explain what each of them measures. In this first part, the focus is on defining a beta component of diversity. This involves deciding what diversity is and how the observed total or gamma diversity ($\gamma$) is partitioned into alpha ($\alpha$) and beta ($\beta$) components. Several different definitions of "beta diversity" that result from these decisions have been used in the ecological literature. True beta diversity is obtained when the total effective number of species in a dataset (true gamma diversity $\gamma$) is multiplicatively partitioned into the effective number of species per compositionally distinct virtual sampling unit (true alpha diversity $\alpha$d) and the effective number of such compositional units ($\beta$Md($\gamma$/$\alpha$d). All true diversities quantify the effective number of types of entities. Because the other variants of "beta diversity" that have been used by ecologists quantify other phenomena, an alternative nomenclature is proposed here for the seven most popular beta components: regional-to-local diversity ratio, two-way diversity ratio, absolute effective species turnover ((regional diversity excess), Whittaker's effective species turnover, proportional effective species turnover, regional entropy excess and regional variance excess. In the second part of the review, the focus will be on how to quantify these phenomena in practice. This involves deciding how the sampling units that contribute to total diversity are selected, and whether the entity that is quantified is all of "beta diversity", a specific part of "beta diversity", the rate of change in "beta diversity" in relation to a given external factor, or something else. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author.

abstract = {Territorial behaviour is a conspicuous determinant of social organisation in many reef fishes including parrotfishes. Most parrotfish studies in the Caribbean have focused on the species Scarus iserti and Sparisoma viride over limited ranges of reef habitat. By contrast, our study has included all common parrotfishes in Belize (Sc. iserti, Sp. viride, Sparisoma aurofrenatum, Sparisoma chrysopterum, and Sparisoma rubripinne) at three sites with different physical and biotic conditions and a wide range of fish densities. Density in Sc. iserti was strongly positively correlated to substrate rugosity. In contrast, densities of Sp. chrysopterum and Sp. rubripinne were unrelated to rugosity and territories were large. Territory size was smallest in Sc. iserti (mean areas at the three sites ranged from 41 to 120m2) and largest in Sp. rubripinne (ranged from 168 to 1400m2). All species except Sp. chrysopterum exhibited significantly larger territories where density was low as suggested by territory theory. Territory size decreased rapidly with increasing density of competitors. Patterns of harem size differed between two groups of parrotfishes. (1) Sc. iserti, Sp. viride, and Sp. aurofrenatum exhibited an expected positive correlation with territory size. (2) Harem size was smaller in Sp. rubripinne and Sp. chrysopterum, and showed no spatial pattern. Aggression in Sp. viride and Sc. iserti was directed entirely towards intraspecifics and positively density dependent. Interspecific interactions accounted for only 10% of observations and were recorded exclusively whilst following Sp. chrysopterum, Sp. rubripinne, and, to a lesser extent, Sp. aurofrenatum. A meta analysis of species interactions suggested that intraspecific interactions were most common where overall fish density was greatest and conversely, interspecific interactions occurred more often at lower densities. This may suggest that the economic defensibility of territories is largely confined to intraspecifics where density is greatest. Most (62%) of the interspecific interactions comprised Sp. rubripinne chasing the smaller species Sp. chrysopterum, suggesting that territorial behaviour has at least some non-reproductive origin and may therefore be associated with either food or shelter. It is feasible that at such low population densities, it is economically feasible for Sp. rubripinne to defend against intraspecifics and Sp. chrysopterum. Social behaviour in Sp. chrysopterum and Sp. rubripinne, and to a lesser extent Sp. aurofrenatum, differs to that of Sc. iserti and Sp. viride which conform to existing theories of social behaviour in reef fish.},

abstract = {Functional richness, currently defined as the amount of niche space occupied by the species within a community, is one of the three major components of functional diversity. Different indices have been developed in order to quantify this component. However, the range of indices available for assessing functional richness, often mathematically complex and based on different rationales, can cause confusion for field ecologists and lead to misinterpretation of the results obtained. In this context, we have provided the first study exclusively focused on the comparison of the definitions, advantages and drawbacks of a large set of functional richness indices. The first part of this work is focused on four indices (FDP&G, FRic, TOP and N-hypervolumes indices) that are currently the most commonly used for assessing functional richness. We have completed our study by including recently developed indices that enable us to take into account the intraspecific trait variability (i.e. FRim index and TDP framework), because there is currently a growing scientific consensus regarding the necessity of including this aspect in the assessment of the functional diversity of communities. We demonstrate that although authors have argued that their index describes the functional richness, each of them describes only part of it, and this part may strongly differ from one index to another. Rather than advocating the general use of a single index and/or systematically avoiding others, our study highlights the need for selecting indices in close relation with the context, the available data and the aims of each study. Such a strategy is an essential preliminary step for preventing misunderstanding and artefactual controversies. Along these lines, we propose some guidelines to help users in selecting the most appropriate indices according both to the facet of functional richness on which they wish to focus and to the characteristics of the available data.},

For CLO, data of the missions SEAWIFS (1997-2009) and MODIS-AQUA (2002-2013) were combined, while for TSM, data from AVHRR (1985-2009) and MODIS AQUA (2002-2013) were combined. To analyze the variability within the annual scale, two techniques were analyzed, the harmonic adjustment method and the climatological averages for both temporal series. Our results indicate that temporal se- ries of CLO on the continental shelf cannot be analyzed by har- monic adjustment. Hence seasonal variability must be calcu- lated through climatological averages. While for SST, harmonic adjustment for the study region presented values higher than 90 % of the variance explained, therefore it is a good estimate of the seasonal variability.

abstract = {Coral reefs provide ecosystem goods and services for millions of people in the tropics, but reef conditions are declining worldwide. Effective solutions to the crisis facing coral reefs depend in part on understanding the context under which different types of conservation benefits can be maximized. Our global analysis of nearly 1,800 tropical reefs reveals how the intensity of human impacts in the surrounding seascape, measured as a function of human population size and accessibility to reefs (“gravity”), diminishes the effectiveness of marine reserves at sustaining reef fish biomass and the presence of top predators, even where compliance with reserve rules is high. Critically, fish biomass in high-compliance marine reserves located where human impacts were intensive tended to be less than a quarter that of reserves where human impacts were low. Similarly, the probability of encountering top predators on reefs with high human impacts was close to zero, even in high-compliance marine reserves. However, we find that the relative difference between openly fished sites and reserves (what we refer to as conservation gains) are highest for fish biomass (excluding predators) where human impacts are moderate and for top predators where human impacts are low. Our results illustrate critical ecological trade-offs in meeting key conservation objectives: reserves placed where there are moderate-to-high human impacts can provide substantial conservation gains for fish biomass, yet they are unlikely to support key ecosystem functions like higher-order predation, which is more prevalent in reserve locations with low human impacts.},

abstract = {Despite two centuries of exploration, our understanding of factors determining the distribution of life on Earth is in many ways still in its infancy. Much of the disagreement about governing processes of variation in species richness may be the result of differences in our perception of species-richness patterns. Until recently, most studies of large-scale species-richness patterns assumed implicitly that patterns and mechanisms were scale invariant. Illustrated with examples and a quantitative analysis of published data on altitudinal gradients of species richness (n = 204), this review discusses how scale effects (extent and grain size) can influence our perception of patterns and processes. For example, a hump-shaped altitudinal species-richness pattern is the most typical (c. 50%), with a monotonic decreasing pattern (c. 25%) also frequendy reported, but the relative distribution of patterns changes readily with spatial grain and extent. If we are to attribute relative impact to various factors influencing species richness and distribution and to decide at which point along a spatial and temporal continuum they act, we should not ask only how results vary as a function of scale but also search for consistent patterns in these scale effects. The review concludes with suggestions of potential routes for future analytical exploration of species-richness patterns.},

abstract = {It has become almost paradigmatic in the coral reef literature that fishing-induced reductions of parrotfish abundance cause benthic phase shifts from coral to macroalgal dominance. This study examined the alternatives of top-down control of the benthos by parrotfish density and bottom-up control of parrotfish density by the benthos at four Philippine islands in a long-term (7.5–30 years) “natural experiment”. No-take marine reserves (NTMRs) demonstrated that fishing reduced parrotfish density significantly at two islands (Sumilon, Mantigue), but not significantly at two other islands (Apo, Selinog). There was no evidence that cover of hard coral decreased, nor macroalgal cover increased, in fished areas relative to NTMRs, no evidence that parrotfish density affected hard coral cover significantly, and thus no evidence of top-down, fishing-induced benthic phase shifts at all four islands. There was, however, compelling evidence that benthos (cover of dead substrata and hard coral) exerted strong bottom-up control on parrotfish density. This bottom-up control was demonstrated most clearly by major environmental disturbances (e.g. typhoons, coral bleaching) that changed benthic habitat and, subsequently, parrotfish density. As hard coral cover declined (and cover of dead substratum increased), parrotfish density increased and vice versa. This response occurred in both major parrotfish feeding guilds (scrapers and excavators). This long-term study on heavily fished coral reefs suggests that the benthos drives the parrotfish, not the other way around. The paradigm of fishing-induced benthic phase shifts may not apply to all coral reefs at all times. Multiple drivers of benthic change on coral reefs should always be considered.},

Fish assemblages with high taxonomic and functional sensitivity are often exposed to threats but are largely missed by the global network of marine protected areas. We found that areas of high species richness spatially mismatch areas of high taxonomic and functional vulnerability.

abstract = {Herbivorous fishes play a critical role in the maintenance of coral reefs through grazing and cropping of various benthic algae types. Herbivorous fish assemblages are sensitive to changes in the reef environment and are often targeted by local fisheries. This can lead to a decline in ecosystem functions if key groups are reduced. The present study investigates the morphological and ecological trait diversity of herbivorous reef fish assemblages in habitats differing in relative benthic coverage: i) coral-dominated, ii) algae-dominated, and iii) an intermediate habitat. Trait diversity for conspicuous herbivorous fishes was measured using three trait diversity indices: trait richness, trait divergence, and trait evenness. These indices were derived from in situ community surveys and feeding observations, morphological assessment of feeding mechanics from locally collected specimens, and ecological information obtained from published data. Trait diversity, reflected in higher trait evenness and lower trait richness, was lower within algae-dominated habitats than coral-dominated habitats, suggesting that algae-dominated habitats may be compromised by the lack of essential functions provided by key species. These groups reduce algal biomass and may help facilitate the survival and growth of corals, which in turn can increase coral cover. Algae-habitats were dominated with species known to consume macroalgae (rabbitfish and surgeonfish), appearing to provide essential feeding and habitat resources. These species include browsers and croppers that are fundamental in reducing algal biomass and may help facilitate the survival and growth of corals, which in turn can promote reef health. However, this habitat lacked parrotfishes known to remove turf algae and sediments, an essential function for clearing benthic space for coral settlement and other key benthic invertebrates. This study identified several species with overlapping functional roles in the coral-dominated and intermediate habitats. Still, species that were not redundant showed high trait complementarity, suggesting that their removal may result in the loss of unique functions. Importantly, we show that algae-dominated habitats supported high numbers of juvenile fishes especially in species targeted by local artisanal fishers. We also showed that the loss of trait diversity is greater than the loss of species diversity through the comparison of taxonomic and trait $\beta$-diversity, further emphasizing the importance of trait diversity analysis in understanding ecosystem health and maintenance.},

abstract = {Hypotheses proposed to explain the great variation among regions in species richness were tested by examining patterns of species richness of birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles in 336 quadrats covering North America. These patterns were then compared with the regional variation of 21 descriptors of the environment suggested by the hypotheses. Some 80-93% of the variability in species richness could be statistically explained by a monotonically increasing function of annual potential evapotranspiration (PET). Tree richness is more closely related to actual evapotranspiration (AET). Both AET and PET appear to be measures of available environmental energy. Species richness in particular orders and families of the Vertebrata is also closely related to PET, but not always monotonically, often resembling a replacement series along an environmental gradient. -from Author},

abstract = {Patterns of species diversity are essential to understand community structure. We aimed to determine species diversity and patterns of beta diversity in different spatial scales. We sampled three thousand individuals between the coordinates 22°10‘S to 22°16‘S and 47°47‘W to 48°00‘W to assess species diversity in three spatial scales (maximum distances of 80 m, 1,400 m, and 12,000 m), using the point-centered-quarter method. We partitioned gamma diversity into alpha and beta components. Beta diversity was partitioned into dissimilarities produced by spatial species turnover and nestedness. The contribution of beta diversity to gamma diversity was greater than that of alpha diversity in all scales, although the patterns of species diversity were similar for the evaluated scales, and was similar to that described for larger spatial scales. The sampled fragments presented means of 15 exclusive species and 47.5 species per fragment, and dissimilarities [$\beta$(S{\O}R)=0.7] almost completely explained (94%) by spatial species turnover. The results indicate that the remnant fragments are residual patches of an originally heterogeneous vegetation. The fragmentation processes could have progressed differently in each portion of the original vegetation, producing the current heterogeneous vegetation. Thus, there is a potential of high local species extinctions if the remnant fragments are deforested.},

abstract = {The reef flat is one of the largest and most distinctive habitats on coral reefs, yet its role in reef trophodynamics is poorly understood. Evolutionary evidence suggests that reef flat colonization by grazing fishes was a major innovation that permitted the exploitation of new space and trophic resources. However, the reef flat is hydrodynamically challenging, subject to high predation risks and covered with sediments that inhibit feeding by grazers. To explore these opposing influences, we examine the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) as a model system. We focus on grazing herbivores that directly access algal primary productivity in the epilithic algal matrix (EAM). By assessing abundance, biomass, and potential fish productivity, we explore the potential of the reef flat to support key ecosystem processes and its ability to maintain fisheries yields. On the GBR, the reef flat is, by far, the most important habitat for turf-grazing fishes, supporting an estimated 79% of individuals and 58% of the total biomass of grazing surgeonfishes, parrotfishes, and rabbitfishes. Approximately 59% of all (reef-wide) turf algal productivity is removed by reef flat grazers. The flat also supports approximately 75% of all grazer biomass growth. Our results highlight the evolutionary and ecological benefits of occupying shallow-water habitats (permitting a ninefold population increase). The acquisition of key locomotor and feeding traits has enabled fishes to access the trophic benefits of the reef flat, outweighing the costs imposed by water movement, predation, and sediments. Benthic assemblages on reefs in the future may increasingly resemble those seen on reef flats today, with low coral cover, limited topographic complexity, and extensive EAM. Reef flat grazing fishes may therefore play an increasingly important role in key ecosystem processes and in sustaining future fisheries yields.},

abstract = {The notion that relationships between community-weighted mean (CWM) traits (i.e. plot-level trait valuesweighted by species abundances) and environmental conditions reflect selection towards locally optimal phenotypes is challenged by the large amount of interspecific trait variation typically found within ecological communities. Reconciling these contrasting patterns is a key to advancing predictive theories of functional community ecology. We combined data on geographical distributions and three traits (wood density, leaf mass per area and maximumheight) of 173 tree species in Puerto Rico. We tested the hypothesis that species are more likely to occur where their trait values are more similar to the local CWM trait values (the ‘CWM-optimality' hypothesis) by comparing species occurrence patterns (as a proxy for fitness) with the functional composition of forest plots across a precipitation gradient. While 70% of the species supported CWM-optimality for at least one trait, nearly 25% significantly opposed it for at least one trait, thereby contributing to local functional diversity. The majority (85%) of species that opposedCWMoptimality did so only for one trait and few species opposed CWM-optimality in multivariate trait space. Our study suggests that constraints to local functional variation act more strongly on multivariate phenotypes than on univariate traits.},

abstract = {The epibenthic macroinvertebrate community of rocky reefs in the Gulf of California is composed of 140 species, and structured in three distinct communities spatially segregated, which relate to sea surface temperature and chlorophyll a concentrations. We provide quantitative evidence of a prominent shift in the taxa dominating these communities, particularly sessile taxa (Cnidaria, Bivalvia, Annelida, Ascidiacea and Porifera). This pattern was not found in non-sessile taxa (Echinodermata, Decapoda, Cephalopoda, Gastropoda and Polycladida). The northern region (>28° N) was a temperate zone with the coolest water in winter and highest chlorophyll a concentrations, where Octocorallia of the genus Muricea were the dominant taxa. The central region ($\sim$24-28° N) had a mix of oceanographic features of the northern and southern regions and was dominated by Echinodermata in terms of species richness and density. The southern region (<24° N) is a subtropical zone with typically warm and clear water, and dominated by Hexacorallia (stony corals). The southern area was less diverse and had lower densities than the central and northern area. Based on the spatial structure found, eight sessile and suspensivore species, not affected by fisheries, were selected for niche estimation and modeling with MaxEnt; azooxanthellate stony coral Ceratotrochus franciscana and octocoral Eugorgia aurantiaca from the Northern region; sponge Dragmacidon mexicanum, zooxanthellate stony coral Pavona gigantean and octocoral Leptogorgia rigida from the Southern region; and ascidian ascidia Rhopalaea birkelandi, hydrozoan Plumularia spp. and octocoral Muricea appressa from the Central region. As environmental variables, we used the bathymetry and sea superficial temperature, and chlorophyll a as a proxy for food density. The spatial distribution of species density was further estimated with the Niche Centroide Distance method. The results showed a strong dependence of the niche on environmental variables like temperature for all sessile species. We also chose the sea star Acanthaster planci, a non-sessile species that feeds on stony coral and is reported to inhabit tropical areas. However, our analysis showed that A. planci is not abundant in coral reef areas in the Southern region. Therefore, we estimated fields of possible prey abundance, and used them as biotic variables (stony coral, hydrozoans and octocorals), as well as environmental and input variables for niche estimation. The results indicate that the main variables shaping the niche of A. planci were hydrozoans and octocorals of the Central regions, while environmental variables were marginally secondary in niche determination. All these niche models indicated the sessile species are linked with environmental conditions while non-sessile species had a dependence for biotic conditions as food availability},

abstract = {Recent theory, such as the insurance hypothesis, suggests that higher species diversity may dampen perturbation dynamics within a community. The dynamics of a rocky intertidal macroalgal community were evaluated using an experimentally induced heat stress applied at the end ofa 15-mo manipulation ofdiversity. This pulse event produced a gradient of thermal stress within plots and, consequently, different degrees of perturbation. In gen- eral, the resistance of the community to the thermal stress was forecast by the pre-stress cover of dominant species, total algal cover, and standing biomass. Because higher diversity treatments, especially those containing the dominant algal group, fucoids, had higher overall abundance, highest diversity treatments were the most severely affected. The stress was also relatively nonselective, in that species were reduced in roughly equivalent proportions, suggesting an important distinction for predicting when diversity will not influence dis- turbance dynamics. The resilience of the community was strongly dependent on which species were initially present in the plots and the degree of disturbance. In highly disturbed areas, although the recovery trajectory was similar in early successional stages, differences emerged later; these differences appear to be attributable to the composition of the sur- rounding regeneration pool. For treatments not receiving the thermal stress, low-diversity plots without fucoids remained in states unlike the reference condition for most of the monitored resilience period. But plots in high-diversity treatments, even areas within plots that had experienced moderate disturbance, returned to states similar to the reference quick- ly. Thus, resilience (but not resistance) results are consistent with the insurance hypothesis. Overall, diversity's influence on community dynamics is complex and will depend on the characteristics of the stress as well as the characteristics of the species present in the community.},

abstract = {Herbivory by fishes has been identified as a key ecological process shaping coral reefs through time. Although taxonomically limited, herbivorous reef fishes display a wide range of traits, which results in varied ecosystem functions on reefs around the world. Yet, we understand little about how these trait combinations and functions in ecosystems changed through time and across biogeographic realms. Here, we used fossils and phylogenies in a functional ecological framework to reveal temporal changes in nominally herbivorous fish assemblages among oceanic basins in both trait space and lineage richness among functions. We show that the trait space occupied by extant herbivorous fishes in the Indo-Pacific resulted from an expansion of traits from the ancestral Tethyan assemblages. By contrast, trait space in the Atlantic is the result of lineage turnover, with relatively recent colonization by lineages that arose in the east Tethys/Indo-Pacific. From an ecosystem function perspective, the Atlantic supports a depauperate fauna, with few extant herbivorous reef fish lineages performing each function. Indo-Pacific fishes support both more functions and more lineages within each function, with a marked Miocene to Pleistocene expansion. These disparities highlight the importance of history in explaining global variation in fish functional composition on coral reefs.},

abstract = {Fishes are the most diverse group of vertebrates, play key functional roles in aquatic ecosystems, and provide protein for a billion people, especially in the developing world. Those functions are compromised by mounting pressures on marine biodiversity and ecosystems. Because of its economic and food value, fish biomass production provides an unusually direct link from biodiversity to critical ecosystem services. We used the Reef Life Survey's global database of 4,556 standardized fish surveys to test the importance of biodiversity to fish production relative to 25 environmental drivers. Temperature, biodiversity, and human influence together explained 47% of the global variation in reef fish biomass among sites. Fish species richness and functional diversity were among the strongest predictors of fish biomass, particularly for the largebodied species and carnivores preferred by fishers, and these biodiversity effects were robust to potentially confounding influences of sample abundance, scale, and environmental correlations. Warmer temperatures increased biomass directly, presumably by raising metabolism, and indirectly by increasing diversity, whereas temperature variability reduced biomass. Importantly, diversity and climate interact, with biomass of diverse communities less affected by rising and variable temperatures than species-poor communities. Biodiversity thus buffers global fish biomass from climate change, and conservation of marine biodiversity can stabilize fish production in a changing ocean.},

By performing reflection THG measurements relative to a silicon standard, we have unambiguously determined the magnitude of the third-order susceptibility associated with tripling the fundamental of the Nd:YAG laser to be (3)(3;/B) =(42)×10-10 esu, where (3) refers to that component of the third-order susceptibility tensor with all indices parallel to the chain direction. By measuring anisotropic THG in oriented films, we have shown that this component dominates. The magntiude and anisotropy are directly compared with results obtained from single crystals of polydiacetylene-(toluene- sulfonate) measured in the same apparatus. Finally, we have measured THG in both cis-rich and trans isomers of the same sample. We found that the measured response of the cis-rich samples scales with the residual trans content of the sample; (3) of the trans isomer is 15 20 times larger than that of the cis isomer. This symmetry-specific aspect of (3) implies a mechanism which is sensitive to the existence of a degenerate ground state, as in trans-(CH)x; it is consistent with the virtual generation of nonlinear solitons as a mechanism for the large measured third-order nonlinear-optical susceptibility of polyacetylene. {\textcopyright} 1988 The American Physical Society.},

Apart from the economic valuation of the direct and indirect benefits of biodiversity, people place existence values on biodiversity, i.e. they consider the existence of particular species, regardless of the services they provide. There is also a general recognition that species diversity indicates the status of the ecosystem or community, and thus the quality of the living environment; hence, both at academic and institutional level, there is a lively discussion about how to properly measure and monitor biodiversity. Although many candidates have been proposed, nowadays, no scientific consensus measure exists, and this is mainly due to three motivations: the large number of properties that an indicator of biodiversity should meet, the definition of biodiversity, and the specific interests of policymakers or stakeholders that indicators should satisfy. Because most existing indices neglect the multivariate nature of biodiversity, we address this drawback by proposing a functional approach to Hill's numbers for assessing changes in species variety of ecological communities over time. New functional tools are developed, both analytical and graphical: we present “the biodiversity surface”, “the volume under the biodiversity surface”, and some indicators which have been derived from them. This functional multivariate approach provides additional tools to the existing biodiversity monitoring techniques, and allows us to address biodiversity by considering both richness and evenness, and all of their possible shades. The goal of this research is to provide policymakers, stakeholders, and scholars with additional tools for improving the understanding of biodiversity dynamics within ecological communities.},

We investigate how trophic position and diet breadth influence functional trait evolution in one of the most species-rich and complex vertebrate assemblages, coral reef fishes, within a large-scale phylogenetic framework. We show that, in contrast with established theory, functional traits evolve fastest in trophic specialists with narrow diet breadths at both very low and high trophic positions. Top trophic level specialists exhibit the most functional diversity, while omnivorous taxa with intermediate trophic positions and wide diet breadth have the least functional diversity. Our results reveal the importance of trophic position in shaping evolutionary dynamics while simultaneously highlighting the incredible trophic and functional diversity present in coral reef fish assemblages.},

In this study, we used a large-scale database on the status of coral reef communities in the Caribbean and analysed it in combination with a comprehensive set of socioeconomic and environmental databases to decouple confounding factors and identify the drivers of change in coral reef communities. Our results indicated that human activities related to agricultural land use, coastal development, overfishing and climate change had created independent and overwhelming responses in fishes, corals and macroalgae. While the effective implementation of marine protected areas (MPAs) increased the biomass of fish populations, coral reef builders and macroalgae followed patterns of change independent of MPAs. However, we also found significant ecological links among all these groups of organisms suggesting that the long-term stability of coral reefs as a whole requires a holistic and regional approach to the control of human-related stressors in addition to the improvement and establishment of new MPAs. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Aim: The functional composition of local assemblages is hypothesized to be controlled by hierarchical environmental filters, whereby the importance of different abiotic and biotic factors varies across both spatial scales and the different dimensions of functional diversity. We examine scale dependence in functional diversity–environment relationships with the ultimate aim of advancing models that predict the response of functional diversity to global change. Location: Coral reefs surrounding 23 minimally disturbed central-western Pacific islands. Time period: 2010–2015. Major taxa studied: Coral reef fishes. Methods: We surveyed 1,423 reef sites using a standardized monitoring protocol and classified the 547 taxa encountered based on traits related to resource use, body size and behaviour. For each fish community, we calculated species richness and three metrics of functional diversity: functional richness, functional redundancy and functional evenness. We then built nested models at three spatial scales to evaluate the predictive power of environmental conditions over each component of functional diversity. Results: Climatic variables (e.g., primary productivity) and geomorphic context (e.g., bathymetric slope) were more important in predicting functional diversity at coarse spatial scales. In contrast, local measures of habitat quality, including benthic complexity, depth and hard coral cover, were generally most important at finer scales. All diversity metrics were better predicted at coarser scales, but which predictors were important varied among metrics. Main conclusions: The observed scale dependence in environmental predictors of functional diversity generally matches models of hierarchical filters on functional community assembly. Contrary to expectation, however, functional evenness and functional redundancy, which incorporate information on biomass distributions, were not better predicted at finer spatial scales. Instead, broad-scale variation in environmental variables was most important in predicting all components of functional diversity. Furthermore, the distinct responses of each functional diversity metric to environmental variation indicate that each measures a unique dimension of reef-fish diversity, and environmental change may affect each differently.},

abstract = {Community assembly processes are thought to shape the mean, spread, and spacing of functional trait values within communities. Two broad categories of assembly processes have been proposed: first, a habitat filter that restricts the range of viable strategies and second, a partitioning of microsites and/or resources that leads to a limit to the similarity of coexisting species. The strength of both processes may be dependent on conditions at a particular site and may change along an abiotic gradient. We sampled environmental variables and plant communities in 44 plots across the varied topography of a coastal California landscape. We characterized 14 leaf, stem, and root traits for 54 woody plant species, including detailed intraspecific data for two traits with the goal of understanding the connection between traits and assembly processes in a variety of environmental conditions. We examined the within-community mean, range, variance, kurtosis, and other measures of spacing of trait values. In this landscape, there was a topographically mediated gradient in water availability. Across this gradient we observed strong shifts in both the plot-level mean trait values and the variation in trait values within communities. Trends in trait means with the environment were due largely to species turnover, with intraspecific shifts playing a smaller role. Traits associated with a vertical partitioning of light showed a greater range and variance on the wet soils, while nitrogen per area, which is associated with water use efficiency, showed a greater spread on the dry soils. We found strong nonrandom patterns in the trait distributions consistent with expectations based on trait-mediated community assembly. There was a significant reduction in the range of six out of 11 leaf and stem functional trait values relative to a null model. For specific leaf area (SLA) we found a significant even spacing of trait values relative to the null model. For seed size we found a more platykurtic distribution than expected. These results suggest that both a habitat filter and a limit to the similarity of coexisting species can simultaneously shape the distribution of traits and the assembly of local plant communities.},

Traditionally, ecologists have explored linkages between the severity and type of disturbance and the taxonomic structure of communities. Recent advances in the application of species traits, to assess the functional structure of communities, have provided an alternative approach that responds rapidly and consistently across taxa and ecosystems to multiple disturbances. Importantly, trait-based metrics may provide advanced warning of disturbance to ecosystems because they do not need species loss to be reactive. Here, we synthesize empirical evidence and present a theoretical framework, based on species positions in a functional space, as a tool to reveal the complex nature of change in disturbed ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {While undeniably successful in protecting nearshore marine ecosystems from overfishing, conventional marine reserves often impinge on the livelihoods of dependent coastal communities. Community co-managed areas may guarantee considerably more equity, but it is unclear if they can be as effective as conventional reserves in conserving critical trophic functions. We evaluated the effectiveness of different management regimes in the Gulf of California on fish biomass and echinoderm assemblages as proxies of key ecosystem processes on rocky shores. We compared multiple sites in a mixed (multi-use areas with regulated extraction) and core (no-extraction) federally-managed areas, a military MPA (where strict patrolling ensures no extraction), a co-managed reserve where government and communities are equally responsible, and unrestricted-access areas (non MPA). Fish biomass was higher in the military reserve and the community co-managed area reserve; echinoderm numbers were very low at these locations suggesting that they were strongly controlled by top-down processes. In contrast, federally-controlled reserves were virtually no different from unrestricted-access areas in numbers or composition of fish and echinoderms. Although federal managed reserves are the most common management regime across the Gulf, our data shows that they are highly ineffective in protecting ecosystem function. The relative effectiveness of co-managed reserves in this region suggests that fishers are more willing to comply when they have a stake in decision-making. Coastal conservation can benefit greatly by drawing from a wider suite of management options that engage local communities as key participants in the managing marine diversity and critical ecosystem functions.},

abstract = {The world's coral reefs are in decline, with many exhibiting a phase shift from coral to macroalgal dominance [1-6]. This change is often associated with habitat loss and overharvesting of herbivorous fishes, particularly parrotfishes and surgeonfishes [6-9]. The challenge is to reverse this decline and enhance the resilience of coral-reef ecosystems [10, 11]. We demonstrate, by using a large-scale experimentally induced phase shift, that the rapid reversal from a macroalgal-dominated to a coral- and epilithic algal-dominated state was not a result of herbivory by parrotfishes or surgeonfishes. Surprisingly, phase-shift reversal was primarily driven by a single batfish species (Platax pinnatus), a fish previously regarded as an invertebrate feeder. The 43 herbivorous fishes in the local fauna played only a minor role, suggesting that biodiversity may not offer the protection we hoped for in complex ecosystems. Our findings highlight the dangers faced by coral reefs and other threatened complex ecosystems: Species or functional groups that prevent phase shifts may not be able to reverse phase shifts once they occur. Nevertheless, reversal is possible. The critical issue is to identify and protect those groups that underpin the resilience and regeneration of complex ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Understanding how emergent ecological assemblages have diverged from natural states is fundamental in predicting future functioning and services of ecosystems. Coral reefs are of particular concern due to their high susceptibility to anthropogenic stressors. Yet, little is known about their pre-disturbance ranges of natural states, and most reports of decline are based on a limited number of sites and high levels of uncertainty. Here, we used a novel approach to estimate the physical functionality of reefs across marine ecoregions based on habitat suitability and morpho-functional traits for coral species. We calibrated ecological niche models for 49 reef-building corals of the Greater Caribbean based on occurrence records and environmental predictors, which we combined with species-specific functional coefficients derived from morpho-functional traits reflecting their contribution to the reef three-dimensional structure to estimate the reef functional potential (RFP). We then assessed the degree of divergence of western Caribbean reefs by comparing our physical functionality estimates against recent field data evaluations. We found spatial variability in RFP across the Caribbean, with the highest mean value in the western Caribbean and the lowest in areas with marginal environmental conditions. Hotspots of RFP exist along the coast of Belize and the southeast of Cuba. Overall, 84% of sites along the western Caribbean showed a substantial reduction in their physical functioning, with the highest reductions occurring within hotspots, implying that reefs displaying the greatest changes have high initial RFP. We conclude that combining niche models with species morpho-functional traits is a valuable and promising approach to estimate the large-scale functional potential of communities and the degree of change in the absence of ecological baselines. These findings have important implications and could be used to guide efforts to preserve coral reefs functionality and define priority conservation areas in the Caribbean.},

abstract = {We studied parrotfish (Scaridae) assemblages on coral reefs in relation to fishing pressure around six Caribbean islands. Fishing intensity ranged from virtually none in Bonaire, and increased through Saba, Puerto Rico, St Lucia and Dominica to extremely high levels in Jamaica. In St Lucia we also compared parrotfish assemblages between fishing grounds and fully protected marine reserves, from 1995, 6 months prior to establishment, to 2001. Within each country we performed replicate counts of the number and size of all parrotfish species within, or passing through our counting area. From these data we calculated biomass for seven species. Biomass of the two largest species, Sparisoma viride and Scarus vetula, was greatest in islands with low fishing pressure (P < 0.001). By contrast, smaller species constituted an increasing proportion of the total parrotfish assemblage as fishing pressure increased (P < 0.001 in all cases). Parrotfish are protogynous hermaphrodites with two distinct colour phases. The initial phase is predominantly female, and the terminal phase exclusive to sexually mature males. The average size of all species except Sc. vetula tended to decrease with increasing fishing pressure. Furthermore, percentages of fish that were terminal phase males showed order of magnitude declines with increasing fishing pressure for Sp. viride and Sc. vetula. Terminal males of these species were absent from counts in Jamaica and virtually absent from Dominica suggesting that persistence of these populations may depend on recruitment from distant sources. Following reserve implementation in St Lucia, all species, except uncommon Sp. chrysopterum, increased in mean biomass (P < 0.001 in all cases). In 6 years the total biomass for all species combined increased to become nearly four times as high in reserves and almost twice as high in fishing grounds [P < 0.001 (year effect); P < 0.001 (protection effect); P < 0.001 (yearxprotection)], and mean size of five species increased significantly in both reserves and fishing grounds. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We found a positive effect of MPAs on biomass and community structure, as almost all commercially important species were more abundant in MPAs. Apex predators, carnivores and herbivores showed higher biomasses in protected areas, while planktivorous were similar among sites. As well, target species of artisanal fisheries and dive-ornamental fisheries were larger in MPAs. Areas closed to fishing can contribute to keeping biomass high, improve species richness in the region, and help to recover ecosystem services in coral reefs, even in anthropogenic impacted areas. The improving of regulations in and out of MPAs will assure the ecosystem services and life quality of coastal populations.},

abstract = {Susceptibility to human-driven environmental changes is mediated by species traits. Therefore, identifying traits that predict organism performance, ecosystem function and response to changes in environmental conditions can help forecast how ecosystems are responding to the Anthropocene. Morphology dictates how organisms interact with their environment and other organisms, partially determining the environmental and biological contexts in which they are successful. Morphology is important for autogenic ecosystem engineering organisms, such as reef-building corals, because it determines the shape of the structures they create and by extension the communities they support. Here, we present six morphological traits that capture variation in volume compactness, surface complexity and top-heaviness. With support from the literature, we propose causal links between morphology and a performance–function–response framework. To illustrate these concepts, we combine 3D scanning and coral survey data to predict morphological traits from in situ colonies. We present a case study that examines how assemblage-scale morphological traits have responded to two cyclones and the 2016 mass bleaching event—two phenomena predicted to increase in severity in the Anthropocene—and discuss how these changes may impact ecosystem function. The morphological traits outlined here offer a generalised and hypothesis-driven approach to tracking how reefs respond to the Anthropocene. The ability to predict these traits from field data and the increasing use of photogrammetry makes them readily applicable across broad spatiotemporal scales. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

abstract = {While environmental filters are well-known factors influencing community assembly, the extent to which these modify species functions, and entire ecosystem processes, is poorly understood. Focusing on a high-diversity system, we ask whether environmental filtering has ecosystem-wide effects beyond community assembly. We characterise a coral reef herbivorous fish community for swimming performance based on ten functional traits derived from fish morphology. We then investigate whether wave exposure modifies the functional make-up of herbivory, and the absolute and relative feeding frequency of distinct feeding functional groups. Herbivorous fish species conformed to either laterally compressed or fusiform body plans, which differ in their morphological design to minimise drag. High wave exposure selectively limited the feeding function of the deepest body shapes with highest caudal thrust efficiency, and favoured fusiform bodies irrespective of pectoral fin shape. Traditionally recognised herbivore feeding functional groups (i.e. grazers–detritivores and scrapers–small excavators) differed in swimming performance, and in their capacity to feed consistently across levels of wave exposure. We therefore emphasise the distinctness of their ecological niche and functional complementarity. Species within the same feeding functional group also had contrasting responses to wave exposure. We thereby reveal a further ecological dimension of niche partitioning, and reiterate the risk of assuming functional redundancy among species with a common feeding mode. Contrasting responses of species within feeding functional roles (i.e. response diversity) allowed the preservation of critical trophic functions throughout the gradient (e.g. macroalgal browsing), and likely explained why overall levels of herbivory were robust to filtering. Whether ecosystem functioning will remain robust under the additive effects of environmental stress and human-induced disturbances remains to be tested. A lay summary is available for this article.},

The total number of species recorded by both sampling methods was similar, even though UWV recorded higher mean number of species than VC, in both reservoirs. In general, VC was more efficient in recording cryptic and resident species, while UWV, was better for highly mobile species. Considering size classes, VC was more efficient than UWV in detecting smaller individuals (i.e., 31–79 mm total length). Although observational sampling methods depend on water transparency, UWV can be considered a complementary and promising technique for fish surveys in shallow areas of clear reservoirs.},

abstract = {Tropicalization is a term used to describe the transformation of temperate ecosystems by poleward-moving tropical organisms in response to warming temperatures. In North America, decreases in the frequency and intensity of extreme winter cold events are expected to allow the poleward range expansion of many cold-sensitive tropical organisms, sometimes at the expense of temperate organisms. Although ecologists have long noted the critical ecological role of winter cold temperature extremes in tropical–temperate transition zones, the ecological effects of extreme cold events have been understudied, and the influence of warming winter temperatures has too often been left out of climate change vulnerability assessments. Here, we examine the influence of extreme cold events on the northward range limits of a diverse group of tropical organisms, including terrestrial plants, coastal wetland plants, coastal fishes, sea turtles, terrestrial reptiles, amphibians, manatees, and insects. For these organisms, extreme cold events can lead to major physiological damage or landscape-scale mass mortality. Conversely, the absence of extreme cold events can foster population growth, range expansion, and ecological regime shifts. We discuss the effects of warming winters on species and ecosystems in tropical–temperate transition zones. In the 21st century, climate change-induced decreases in the frequency and intensity of extreme cold events are expected to facilitate the poleward range expansion of many tropical species. Our review highlights critical knowledge gaps for advancing understanding of the ecological implications of the tropicalization of temperate ecosystems in North America.},

abstract = {Our ability to understand natural constraints on coral reef benthic communities requires quantitative assessment of the relative strengths of abiotic and biotic processes across large spatial scales. Here, we combine underwater images, visual censuses and remote sensing data for 1566 sites across 34 islands spanning the central-western Pacific Ocean, to empirically assess the relative roles of abiotic and grazing processes in determining the prevalence of calcifying organisms and fleshy algae on coral reefs. We used regression trees to identify the major predictors of benthic composition and to test whether anthropogenic stress at inhabited islands decouples natural relationships. We show that sea surface temperature, wave energy, oceanic productivity and aragonite saturation strongly influence benthic community composition; overlooking these factors may bias expectations of calcified reef states. Maintenance of grazing biomass above a relatively low threshold ($\sim$ 10–20 kg ha−1) may also prevent transitions to algal-dominated states, providing a tangible management target for rebuilding overexploited herbivore populations. Biophysical relationships did not decouple at inhabited islands, indicating that abiotic influences remain important macroscale processes, even at chronically disturbed reefs. However, spatial autocorrelation among inhabited reefs was substantial and exceeded abiotic and grazing influences, suggesting that natural constraints on reef benthos were superseded by unmeasured anthropogenic impacts. Evidence of strong abiotic influences on reef benthic communities underscores their importance in specifying quantitative targets for coral reef management and restoration that are realistic within the context of local conditions.},

abstract = {The Pacific sardine, Sardinops sagax, is the most important fishery by volume in Mexico; however, this small pelagic species shows fluctuations in catch due to its susceptibility to environmental changes. In turn, this susceptibility leads to variations in distribution, abundance, and recruitment, making the Pacific sardine highly vulnerable to the effects of global climate change. In this study, we analyze the effects of environmental variability on the Pacific sardine distribution through the development of the habitat suitability for the Mexican Pacific. We used bathymetry, sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS) and net primary productivity (NPP) to develop an ecological niche model to forecast the suitable habitat of the Pacific sardine and reproduce the historical patterns for the 2003–2017 period. We then used this model to make future projections to the year 2100 using the emission scenarios RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Under the RCP models, on average, the greatest impact of climate change was observed inside the Gulf of California, with an increase in SST (+1.68 °C) and a decrease in 25% of NPP (−256 mg C m−2 d−1) reducing habitat availability for this species by 95. Stocks on the Pacific coast are projected to fluctuate substantially, similar to past events driven by environmental variability. At the regional level, a loss of suitable habitat of up to 50% is expected by the end of this century for the Pacific sardine.},

Despite numerous scientific expeditions to these islands that have identified this high endemism, few studies have attempted to identify patterns of community structure in subtidal habitats. Using visual census, we surveyed fish and habitat associations at five sites located at two of the three islands of the archipelago. Given the isolation of the archipelago we asked: What is the composition of the reef fish fauna at these isolated islands? What habitats dominate subtidal environments? What influences the abundances of reef fishes? Our analysis confirms that fish communities at the archipielago are dominated by endemic species. The ichthyofauna is comprised of a mixture of subtropical and temperate taxa, with greater similarity to western than eastern South Pacific fauna. We identified different fish assemblages at wave-exposed and wave-sheltered sites. Brown and red macroalgae were correlated with the abundances of some reef fishes. Four broad trophic categories of reef fishes were present at the archipelago, with invertebrate consumers dominating abundance. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantify patterns of community structure in subtidal environments at the Juan Fern{\'{a}}ndez Archipelago.},

abstract = {Coral reefs world-wide are threatened by escalating local and global impacts, and some impacted reefs have shifted from coral dominance to a state dominated by macroalgae. Therefore, there is a growing need to understand the processes that affect the capacity of these ecosystems to return to coral dominance following disturbances, including those that prevent the establishment of persistent stands of macroalgae. Unlike many reefs in the Caribbean, over the last several decades, reefs around the Indo-Pacific island of Moorea, French Polynesia have consistently returned to coral dominance following major perturbations without shifting to a macroalgae-dominated state. Here, we present evidence of a rapid increase in populations of herbivorous fishes following the most recent perturbation, and show that grazing by these herbivores has prevented the establishment of macroalgae following near complete loss of coral on offshore reefs. Importantly, we found the positive response of herbivorous fishes to increased benthic primary productivity associated with coral loss was driven largely by parrotfishes that initially recruit to stable nursery habitat within the lagoons before moving to offshore reefs later in life. These results underscore the importance of connectivity between the lagoon and offshore reefs for preventing the establishment of macroalgae following disturbances, and indicate that protecting nearshore nursery habitat of herbivorous fishes is critical for maintaining reef resilience. {\textcopyright} 2011 Adam et al.},

abstract = {The Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute and the Victorian Department of Natural Resources and Environment conducted a two day joint workshop in October 1999 to examine underwater visual census techniques for the assessment of population structure and biodiversity in temperate coastal marine protected areas. The proposed outcome of the workshop was to establish a consensus on the most appropriate methodologies to use and to standardise methodologies across the temperate Australian states. The workshop goals included determining the types and magnitude of biotic change we want to detect, examining UVC techniques currently in use worldwide, and exploring alternative techniques. A clear outcome from the workshop was that as the current round of MPAs are being developed from a biodiversity perspective, most managers felt that monitoring should be related to this. Because biodiversity is such a broad concept, monitoring should also be broadly based, involving sampling at a range of scales from seascapes, through communities, to populations of individual species. Gary Davis outlined how such a broadly based monitoring program was developed in the Californian Channel Islands. The availability of funding was identified as a major limiting factor in establishing broadly based monitoring programs, and it was clear that funding will be predominantly a state responsibility and be related to individual MPA management. To give an indication of what can be achieved within the current Australian funding network, Hugh Sweatman discussed the types of monitoring being conducted on the GBR with moderate funding, and Graham Edgar discussed monitoring on a shoestring budget in Tasmanian MPAs. Managers will have to accept that existing resources are limited and monitoring programs need to be targetted and have clear and achievable goals. To achieve these goals we need go experimental design, and Mick Keough discussed ways of achieving this with MPAs. One of the most critical points in this design is in determining the effect size that we consider significant.},

abstract = {Corals are major contributors to a range of key ecosystem functions on tropical reefs, including calcification, photosynthesis, nutrient cycling, and the provision of habitat structure. The abundance of corals is declining at multiple scales, and the species composition of assemblages is responding to escalating human pressures, including anthropogenic global warming. An urgent challenge is to understand the functional consequences of these shifts in abundance and composition in different biogeographical contexts. While global patterns of coral species richness are well known, the biogeography of coral functions in provinces and domains with high and low redundancy is poorly understood. Here, we quantify the functional traits of all currently recognized zooxanthellate coral species (n = 821) in both the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic domains to examine the relationships between species richness and the diversity and redundancy of functional trait space. We find that trait diversity is remarkably conserved (>75% of the global total) along latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in species richness, falling away only in species-poor provinces (n < 200), such as the Persian Gulf (52% of the global total), Hawaii (37%), the Caribbean (26%), and the East- Pacific (20%), where redundancy is also diminished. In the more species-poor provinces, large and ecologically important areas of trait space are empty, or occupied by just a few, highly distinctive species. These striking biogeographical differences in redundancy could affect the resilience of critical reef functions and highlight the vulnerability of relatively depauperate, peripheral locations, which are often a low priority for targeted conservation efforts.},

Most species were functionally common but geographically rare. However, we found very weak correlation between functional rarity and evolutionary rarity. Functional rarity was highest for species classified as not evaluated or threatened by the IUCN Red List. The location of functional rarity hotspots (Tropical Eastern Pacific) did not match hotspots of species richness and evolutionary distinctiveness (Indo-Australian Archipelago), nor the currently protected areas.

Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was utilized to identify groups of sites based on similarity of composition, and to correlate environmental trends with such groups. Five distinct groups of sites were recognized: (1) the South and South-eastern coastal reefs (from Guarapari Islands to Santa Catarina, the southernmost Brazilian reefs); (2) the North-eastern coast (extending from the Manuel Luis Reefs to Abrolhos Archipelago); (3) Trindade Island; (4) Fernando de Noronha and Atol das Rocas; and (5) St Paul's Rocks. Water temperature, coral richness, distance from mainland, primary production and shelf width strongly correlated with the diversity and composition of the reef sites.},

abstract = {Trait diversity is believed to influence ecosystem dynamics through links between organismal traits and ecosystem processes. Theory predicts that key traits and high trait redundancy—large species richness and abundance supporting the same traits—can buffer communities against environmental disturbances. While experiments and data from simple ecological systems lend support, large-scale evidence from diverse, natural systems under major disturbance is lacking. Here, using long-term data from both temperate (English Channel) and tropical (Seychelles Islands) fishes, we show that sensitivity to disturbance depends on communities' initial trait structure and initial trait redundancy. In both ecosystems, we found that increasing dominance by climatically vulnerable traits (e.g., small, fast-growing pelagics/corallivores) rendered fish communities more sensitive to environmental change, while communities with higher trait redundancy were more resistant. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the influence of trait structure and redundancy on community sensitivity over large temporal and spatial scales in natural systems. Our results exemplify a consistent link between biological structure and community sensitivity that may be transferable across ecosystems and taxa and could help anticipate future disturbance impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are in global decline. Reversing this trend is a primary management objective but doing so depends on understanding what keeps reefs in desirable states (ie “functional”). Although there is evidence that coral reefs thrive under certain conditions (eg moderate water temperatures, limited fishing pressure), the dynamic processes that promote ecosystem functioning and its internal drivers (ie community structure) are poorly defined and explored. Specifically, despite decades of research suggesting a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning across biomes, few studies have explored this relationship in coral reef systems. We propose a practical definition of coral reef functioning, centered on eight complementary ecological processes: calcium carbonate production and bioerosion, primary production and herbivory, secondary production and predation, and nutrient uptake and release. Connecting research on species niches, functional diversity of communities, and rates of the eight key processes can provide a novel, quantitative understanding of reef functioning and its dependence on coral reef communities that will chart the transition of coral reefs in the Anthropocene. This will contribute urgently needed guidance for the management of these important ecosystems.},

Individual fish were detected inside Kealakekua Bay for up to 612 days but many were detected for much shorter periods (median = 52 days). There were species-specific differences in the scale of movements and habitats used, but most fish utilized between 0.2 and 1.6 km of coastline, and individuals of each species showed some degree of diel habitat shift. A wide variety of reef fishes captured inside the MPA swam back and forth across an MPA boundary intersecting continuous reef (i.e., this boundary was porous to reef fish movements), but only 1 of 11 species tagged crossed a wide sandy channel inside Kealakekua Bay suggesting that this feature may function as a natural barrier to movements. Results indicate relatively small MPAs (>2km of coastline) could provide effective, long-term protection for multi-species assemblages of reef fishes provided that boundaries are situated along major habitat breaks (e. g., large sand channels between reefs) that may serve as natural barriers to reef fish movements. It is crucial that a multi-species approach be used when assessing MPA effectiveness. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The ultimate aim of many statistical studies is to predict the effects of interventions. When we collect data on factors associated with wildres in the west, we are actually searching for something we can intervene upon in order to decrease wildre frequency. When we perform a study on a new cancer drug, we are trying to identify how a patient's illness responds when we intervene upon it by medicating the patient. When we research the correlation between violent television and acts of aggression in children, we are trying to determine whether intervening to reduce children's access to violent television will reduce their aggressiveness. As you have undoubtedly heard many times in statistics classes, "correlation is not causation." A mere association between two variables does not necessarily or even usually mean that one of those variables causes the other. (The famous example of this property is that an increase in ice cream sales is correlated with an increase in violent crime-not because ice cream causes crime, but because both ice cream sales and violent crime are more common in hot weather.) For this reason, the randomized controlled experiment is considered the golden standard of statistics. In a properly randomized controlled experiment, all factors that inuence the outcome variable are either static, or vary at random, except for one-so any change in the outcome variable must be due to that one input variable. Unfortunately, many questions do not lend themselves to randomized controlled experiments. We cannot control the weather, so we can't randomize the variables that affect wildres. We could conceivably randomize the participants in a study about violent television, but it would be difcult to effectively control how much television each child watches, and nearly impossible to know whether we were controlling them effectively or not. Even randomized drug trials can run into problems when participants drop out, fail to take their medication, or misreport their usage. In cases where randomized controlled experiments are not practical, researchers instead perform observational studies, in which they merely record data, rather than controlling it. The problem of such studies is that it is difcult to untangle the causal from the merely correlative. Our common sense tells us that intervening on ice cream sales is unlikely to have any effect on crime, but the facts are not always so clear. Consider, for instance, a recent},

abstract = {Sea temperatures in many tropical regions have increased by almost 1°C over the past 100 years, and are currently increasing at $\sim$1-2°C per century. Coral bleaching occurs when the thermal tolerance of corals and their photosynthetic symbionts (zooxanthellae) is exceeded. Mass coral bleaching has occurred in association with episodes of elevated sea temperatures over the past 20 years and involves the loss of the zooxanthellae following chronic photoinhibition. Mass bleaching has resulted in significant losses of live coral in many parts of the world. This paper considers the biochemical, physiological and ecological perspectives of coral bleaching. It also uses the outputs of four runs from three models of global climate change which simulate changes in sea temperature and hence how the frequency and intensity of bleaching events will change over the next 100 years. The results suggest that the thermal tolerances of reef-building corals are likely to be exceeded every year within the next few decades. Events as severe as the 1998 event, the worst on record, are likely to become commonplace within 20 years. Most information suggests that the capacity for acclimation by corals has already been exceeded, and that adaptation will be too slow to avert a decline in the quality of the world's reefs. The rapidity of the changes that are predicted indicates a major problem for tropical marine ecosystems and suggests that unrestrained warming cannot occur without the loss and degradation of coral reefs on a global scale.},

abstract = {Effective conservation depends largely on people's compliance with regulations. We investigate compliance through the lens of fishers' compliance with marine protected areas (MPAs). MPAs are widely used tools for marine conservation and fisheries management. Studies show that compliance alone is a strong predictor of fish biomass within MPAs. Hence, fishers' compliance is critical for MPA effectiveness. However, there are few empirical studies showing what factors influence fishers' compliance with MPAs. Without such information, conservation planners and managers have limited opportunities to provide effective interventions. By studying 12 MPAs in a developing country (Costa Rica), we demonstrate the role that different variables have on fishers' compliance with MPAs. Particularly, we found that compliance levels perceived by resource users were higher in MPAs (1) with multiple livelihoods, (2) where government efforts against illegal fishing were effective, (3) where fishing was allowed but regulated, (4) where people were more involved in decisions, and (5) that were smaller. We also provide a novel and practical measure of compliance: a compound variable formed by the number illegal fishers and their illegal fishing effort. Our study underlines the centrality of people's behavior in nature conservation and the importance of grounding decision making on the social and institutional realities of each location.},

abstract = {The behaviour of juvenile fishes is critical in establishing the link between recruitment and subsequent adult populations. If juvenile fishes move, they can respond to variation in local conditions before adult home ranges are established. Alternatively, if juveniles establish fixed home ranges at settlement, their decisions may determine future population densities at small spatial scales. Field observations and translocations revealed that juvenile rabbitfishes (Siganuscorallinus and S. doliatus) have small home ranges and strong homing abilities (covering 6 m in 1 h or 36 m within 24 h). Only four of 22 individuals failed to return; all were transferred up-current, suggesting that olfaction is important in homing. Small home ranges and strong homing tendencies in juvenile herbivores suggest that decisions made by recruits will impact the spatial extent of both adult fishes and the functional roles they play within ecosystems.},

abstract = {The use of functional diversity analyses in ecology has grown exponentially over the past two decades, broadening our understanding of biological diversity and its change across space and time. Virtually all ecological sub-disciplines recognise the critical value of looking at species and communities from a functional perspective, and this has led to a proliferation of methods for estimating contrasting dimensions of functional diversity. Differences between these methods and their development generated terminological inconsistencies and confusion about the selection of the most appropriate approach for addressing any particular ecological question, hampering the potential for comparative studies, simulation exercises and meta-analyses. Two general mathematical frameworks for estimating functional diversity are prevailing: those based on dissimilarity matrices (e.g. Rao entropy, functional dendrograms) and those relying on multidimensional spaces, constructed as either convex hulls or probabilistic hypervolumes. We review these frameworks, discuss their strengths and weaknesses and provide an overview of the main R packages performing these calculations. In parallel, we propose a way for organising functional diversity metrics in a unified scheme to quantify the richness, divergence and regularity of species or individuals under each framework. This overview offers a roadmap for confidently approaching functional diversity analyses both theoretically and practically.

The analyses were conducted from data collected by the authors and from the literature. A strong positive correlation was observed between bite rates and sea surface temperature (SST) for the genus Stegastes. A negative correlation was found between bite rates and mean body size for the genera Stegastes and Pomacentrus, but this relationship was not significant when all territorial pomacentrids were analyzed together. A negative correlation between body size and SST was observed for the whole group and for the genera Stegastes, and Pomacentrus. No relationship was found between territory size and feeding rates. Principal Components Analysis showed that differences in feeding rates accounted for most of the variability in the data. It also suggested that body size may be important in characterizing the different genera. In general, tropical species are smaller and have higher bite rates than subtropical ones. This study extended the validity of Bergmann's rule, which states that larger species or larger individuals within species occur towards higher latitudes and/or lower temperatures, for an important group of reef fishes. The identification of large-scale, robust ecological patterns in the feeding ecology of pomacentrid fishes may establish a foundation for predicting large-scale changes in reef fish assemblages with expected future changes in global SST. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

To address these issues, studies have been increasingly focusing on functions of fish that are linked to their main ecological roles in aquatic ecosystems. Fish are indeed known to control other organisms through predation, mediate nutrient fluxes, and can act as ecosystem engineers. Here for each of the key functions played by fish, we present the functional traits that have already been used to assess them. We include traits measurable from observations on living individuals, morphological features measured on preserved organisms or traits categorized using information from the literature, and we discuss their respective advantages and limitations. We then list future research directions to foster a more complete functional approach for fish ecology that needs to incorporate functional traits describing, food provisioning and cultural services while accounting more frequently for intraspecific variability. Finally, we highlight ecological and evolutionary questions that could be addressed using meta-analyses of large trait databases, and how a trait-based framework could provide valuable insights on the mechanistic links between global changes, functional diversity of fish assemblages, and ecosystem services.},

abstract = {How plant functional traits (e.g., seed mass) drive species abundance within communities remains an unsolved question. Borrowing concepts from natural selection theory, we propose that trait-abundance relationships can generally correspond to one of three modes of trait selection: directional (a rectilinear relationship, where species at one end of a trait axis are most abundant), stabilizing (an n-shaped relationship), and disruptive (a u-shaped relationship). Stabilizing selection (i.e., the functional convergence of abundant species) would result from positive density-dependent interactions (e.g., facilitation) or due to generalized trade-offs in resource acquisition/use, while disruptive selection (i.e., the divergence of abundant species) would result from negative density-dependent interactions (e.g., competition) or due to environmental heterogeneity. These selection modes can be interpreted as proxies for community-level trait-fitness functions, which establish the degree to which traits are truly "functional". We searched for selection modes in a desert annual-plant community in Argentina (which was divided into winter and summer guilds) to test the hypothesis that the relative importance of disruptive mechanisms (competition, disturbances) decreases with the increase of abiotic stress, a stabilizing agent. Average density was analyzed as a function of eight traits generally linked to resource acquisition and competitive ability (maximum plant height, leaf size, specific leaf area, specific root length), resource retention and stress tolerance (leaf dissection, leaf dry matter content, specific root volume), and regeneration (seed mass) using multiple quadratic-regression models. Trait selection was stabilizing and/or directional when the environment was harshest (winter) and disruptive and/or directional when conditions were milder (summer). Selection patterns differed between guilds for two important traits: plant height and seed mass. These results suggest that abiotic stress may drive within-community functional convergence independently of the trait considered, opposing the view that some traits may be inherently convergent while others divergent. Our quadratic model-based approach provides standardized metrics of both linear and nonlinear selection that may allow simple comparisons among communities subjected to contrasting environmental conditions. These concepts, rooted in natural selection theory, may clarify the functional link between traits and species abundance, and thus help untangle the contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes on community assembly.},

abstract = {A further biodiversity index is proposed, based on taxonomic (or phylogenetic) relatedness of species, namely the 'variation in taxonomic distinctness' (VarTD, $\Lambda$+) between every pair of species recorded in a study. It complements the previously defined 'average taxonomic distinctness' (AvTD, $\Delta$+), which is the mean path length through the taxonomic tree connecting every pair of species in the list. VarTD is simply the variance of these pairwise path lengths and reflects the unevenness of the taxonomic tree. For example, a species list in which there are several different orders represented only by a single species, but also some genera which are very species-rich, would give a high $\Lambda$+ by comparison with a list (of equivalent $\Delta$+) in which all species tended to be from different families but the same order. VarTD is shown to have the same desirable sampling properties as AvTD, primarily a lack of dependence of its mean value on the sample size (except for unrealistically small samples). Such unbiasedness is of crucial importance in making valid biodiversity comparisons between studies at different locations or times, with differing or uncontrolled degrees of sampling effort. This feature is emphatically not shared by indices related to species richness and also not by properties of the phylogeny adapted from proposals in other, conservation contexts, such as 'average phylogenetic diversity' (AvPD, $\Phi$+). As with AvTD, the VarTD statistic for any local study can be tested for 'departure from expectation', based on a master taxonomy for that region, by constructing a simulation distribution from random subsets of the master list. The idea can be extended to summarising the joint distribution of AvTD and VarTD, so that values from real data sets are compared with a fitted simulation 'envelope' in a 2 d ($\Delta$+, $\Lambda$+) plot. The methodology is applied to 14 species lists of free-living marine nematodes, and related to a master list for UK waters. The combination of AvTD and VarTD picks out, in different ways, some degraded locations (low $\Delta$+, low to normal $\Lambda$+) and the pristine island fauna of the Scillies (normal $\Delta$+, high $\Lambda$+). The 2 indices are also demonstrated to be measuring effectively independent features of the taxonomic tree, at least for this faunal group (although it is shown theoretically that this will not always be the case). The combination of $\Delta$+ and $\Lambda$+ is therefore seen to provide a statistically robust summary of taxonomic (or phylogenetic) relatedness patterns within an assemblage, which has the potential to be applied to a wide range of historical data in the form of simple species lists.},

abstract = {Ongoing and predicted global change makes understanding and predicting species' range shifts an urgent scientific priority. Here, we provide a synthetic perspective on the so far poorly understood effects of interspecific interactions on range expansion rates. We present theoretical foundations for how interspecific interactions may modulate range expansion rates, consider examples from empirical studies of biological invasions and natural range expansions as well as process-based simulations, and discuss how interspecific interactions can be more broadly represented in process-based, spatiotemporally explicit range forecasts. Theory tells us that interspecific interactions affect expansion rates via alteration of local population growth rates and spatial displacement rates, but also via effects on other demographic parameters. The best empirical evidence for interspecific effects on expansion rates comes from studies of biological invasions. Notably, invasion studies indicate that competitive dominance and release from specialized enemies can enhance expansion rates. Studies of natural range expansions especially point to the potential for competition from resident species to reduce expansion rates. Overall, it is clear that interspecific interactions may have important consequences for range dynamics, but also that their effects have received too little attention to robustly generalize on their importance. We then discuss how interspecific interactions effects can be more widely incorporated in dynamic modeling of range expansions. Importantly, models must describe spatiotemporal variation in both local population dynamics and dispersal. Finally, we derive the following guidelines for when it is particularly important to explicitly represent interspecific interactions in dynamic range expansion forecasts: if most interacting species show correlated spatial or temporal trends in their effects on the target species, if the number of interacting species is low, and if the abundance of one or more strongly interacting species is not closely linked to the abundance of the target species.},

abstract = {Studies of atmosphere-ocean interaction in the Pacific of Costa Rican are scarce. To identify oceanographic systems that may be influencing climate near Cocos Island (Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape) we conducted six scientific expeditions between 2007 and 2012. Two automated weather stations were set near Chatham and Wafer bays during the expeditions. Data included records from National Meteorological Institute, Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST). The climate is typical of the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Its seasonality is driven by precipitation variability associated with meridional migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The seasonal cycle has two peaks, in May and July, a relative minimum between them in June, and the absolute minimum in February. Most of the precipitation is recorded from April to November. Most rain events have short duration and low intensity. An SST trend was observed from January 1854 to December 2013, coherent with regional warming temperature observations. From 1998 to 2013 there were changes in distributions of almost all meteorological parameters. The combination of these factors resulted in higher evapotranspiration values through the daily cycle, especially during the night time. Precipitation (P) positive anomalies tended to be associated with positive air surface temperature (AST) and SST anomalies and negative global radiation (GR) anomalies. Negative P anomalies tended to be associated with negative AST, SST and positive GR anomalies. Relative humidity (RH) negative anomalies tend to be associated with positive wind speed (WS) anomalies, and the WS effect is opposite for positive RH anomalies. During the cold Ni{\~{n}}o 3 condition of October 2007, negative P, AST, SST and RH anomalies were observed in concordance with positive WS and GR anomalies, in agreement with the conceptual model of climate system response at Isla del Coco to cold ENSO conditions.},

@article{Baker2008,
abstract = {Since the early 1980s, episodes of coral reef bleaching and mortality, due primarily to climate-induced ocean warming, have occurred almost annually in one or more of the world's tropical or subtropical seas. Bleaching is episodic, with the most severe events typically accompanying coupled ocean-atmosphere phenomena, such as the El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which result in sustained regional elevations of ocean temperature. Using this extended dataset (25+ years), we review the short- and long-term ecological impacts of coral bleaching on reef ecosystems, and quantitatively synthesize recovery data worldwide. Bleaching episodes have resulted in catastrophic loss of coral cover in some locations, and have changed coral community structure in many others, with a potentially critical influence on the maintenance of biodiversity in the marine tropics. Bleaching has also set the stage for other declines in reef health, such as increases in coral diseases, the breakdown of reef framework by bioeroders, and the loss of critical habitat for associated reef fishes and other biota. Secondary ecological effects, such as the concentration of predators on remnant surviving coral populations, have also accelerated the pace of decline in some areas. Although bleaching severity and recovery have been variable across all spatial scales, some reefs have experienced relatively rapid recovery from severe bleaching impacts. There has been a significant overall recovery of coral cover in the Indian Ocean, where many reefs were devastated by a single large bleaching event in 1998. In contrast, coral cover on western Atlantic reefs has generally continued to decline in response to multiple smaller bleaching events and a diverse set of chronic secondary stressors. No clear trends are apparent in the eastern Pacific, the central-southern-western Pacific or the Arabian Gulf, where some reefs are recovering and others are not. The majority of survivors and new recruits on regenerating and recovering coral reefs have originated from broadcast spawning taxa with a potential for asexual growth, relatively long distance dispersal, successful settlement, rapid growth and a capacity for framework construction. Whether or not affected reefs can continue to function as before will depend on: (1) how much coral cover is lost, and which species are locally extirpated; (2) the ability of remnant and recovering coral communities to adapt or acclimatize to higher temperatures and other climatic factors such as reductions in aragonite saturation state; (3) the changing balance between reef accumulation and bioerosion; and (4) our ability to maintain ecosystem resilience by restoring healthy levels of herbivory, macroalgal cover, and coral recruitment. Bleaching disturbances are likely to become a chronic stress in many reef areas in the coming decades, and coral communities, if they cannot recover quickly enough, are likely to be reduced to their most hardy or adaptable constituents. Some degraded reefs may already be approaching this ecological asymptote, although to date there have not been any global extinctions of individual coral species as a result of bleaching events. Since human populations inhabiting tropical coastal areas derive great value from coral reefs, the degradation of these ecosystems as a result of coral bleaching and its associated impacts is of considerable societal, as well as biological concern. Coral reef conservation strategies now recognize climate change as a principal threat, and are engaged in efforts to allocate conservation activity according to geographic-, taxonomic-, and habitat-specific priorities to maximize coral reef survival. Efforts to forecast and monitor bleaching, involving both remote sensed observations and coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models, are also underway. In addition to these efforts, attempts to minimize and mitigate bleaching impacts on reefs are immediately required. If significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved within the next two to three decades, maximizing coral survivorship during this time may be critical to ensuring healthy reefs can recover in the long term. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Many indices have been proposed to measure functional diversity and its four distinct dimensions: functional richness, evenness, divergence and redundancy. Identifying indices that reliably measure the functional diversity dimension(s) of interest requires careful testing of how each index responds to species' traits and abundance distributions. In the absence of a convenient simulation tool, tests with artificial data have to date explored only a limited number of scenarios or have altered trait and abundance distributions only indirectly based on principles of evolution and community assembly. We provide simul.comms, an R function that allows users to test the efficacy of functional diversity indices by easily creating artificial species communities with user-specified abundance and trait distributions for continuous, ordinal and categorical traits. To illustrate the function's utility, we examine the performance of R, a recently published abundance-sensitive index for functional redundancy. We use two approaches to designing simulation tests for this example analysis. The first uses simul.comms to create six separate sets of artificial communities to qualitatively assess how R responds to predictable changes in functional redundancy. The second uses simul.comms to independently alter seven community composition parameters, whose influence on R is then examined quantitatively via effect sizes in linear regression. Our analyses indicate that R broadly mirrors expected changes in functional redundancy and predictably responds to changes in community composition parameters. R appears, however, to primarily reflect trait distributions, responding minimally to variance in abundance and counter-intuitively to abundance range. Further refinement of tools to measure functional redundancy may therefore be desirable. The R tool we provide should assist with refining functional diversity measures, a critical step towards improving our ability to understand and mitigate the impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning. Because simul.comms simply produces two linked matrices, a species-by-traits matrix and a site-by-species abundance matrix, it may be equally valuable in exploring questions and analytical approaches in other areas of community ecology.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are of undeniable importance to the environment, yet little is known of them on a global scale. Assessments rely on laborious, local in-water surveys. In recent years remote sensing has been useful on larger scales for certain aspects of reef science such as benthic functional type discrimination. However, remote sensing only gives indirect information about reef condition. Only through combination of remote sensing and in situ data can we achieve coverage to understand reef condition and monitor worldwide condition. This work presents an approach to global mapping of coral reef condition that intelligently selects local, in situ measurements that refine the accuracy and resolution of global remote sensing. To this end, we apply new techniques in remote sensing analysis, probabilistic modeling for coral reef mapping, and decision theory for sample selection. Our strategy represents a fundamental change in how we study coral reefs and assess their condition on a global scale. We demonstrate feasibility and performance of our approach in a proof of concept using spaceborne remote sensing together with high-quality airborne data from the NASA Earth Venture Suborbital-2 (EVS-2) Coral Reef Airborne Laboratory (CORAL) mission as a proxy for in situ samples. Results indicate that our method is capable of extrapolating in situ features and refining information from remote sensing with increasing accuracy. Furthermore, the results confirm that decision theory is a powerful tool for sample selection.},

abstract = {Although ecosystem services are increasingly recognized as benefits people obtain from nature, we still have a poor understanding of how they actually enhance multidimensional human well-being, and how well-being is affected by ecosystem change. We develop a concept of “ecosystem service elasticity” (ES elasticity) that describes the sensitivity of human well-being to changes in ecosystems. ES Elasticity is a result of complex social and ecological dynamics and is context dependent, individually variable, and likely to demonstrate nonlinear dynamics such as thresholds and hysteresis. We present a conceptual framework that unpacks the chain of causality from ecosystem stocks through flows, goods, value, and shares to contribute to the well-being of different people. This framework builds on previous conceptualizations, but places multidimensional well-being of different people as the final element. This ultimately disaggregated approach emphasizes how different people access benefits and how benefits match their needs or aspirations. Applying this framework to case studies of individual coastal ecosystem services in East Africa illustrates a wide range of social and ecological factors that can affect ES elasticity. For example, food web and habitat dynamics affect the sensitivity of different fisheries ecosystem services to ecological change. Meanwhile high cultural significance, or lack of alternatives enhance ES elasticity, while social mechanisms that prevent access can reduce elasticity. Mapping out how chains are interlinked illustrates how different types of value and the well-being of different people are linked to each other and to common ecological stocks. We suggest that examining chains for individual ecosystem services can suggest potential interventions aimed at poverty alleviation and sustainable ecosystems while mapping out of interlinkages between chains can help to identify possible ecosystem service trade-offs and winners and losers. We discuss conceptual and practical challenges of applying such a framework and conclude on its utility as a heuristic for structuring interdisciplinary analysis of ecosystem services and human wellbeing.},

abstract = {Herbivory is an important driver of community structure on coral reefs. Adequate understanding of herbivory will mandate better knowledge of how specific herbivores impact reef communities and the redundancy versus complementarity of their ecological roles. We used algal communities generated by herbivore manipulations to assess such roles among Caribbean herbivorous fishes. We created large enclosures on a 16- to 18-m-deep reef to create treatments grazed for 10 months by: (1) only Sparisoma aurofrenatum, (2) only Acanthurus bahianus, (3) no large herbivorous fishes, or (4) natural densities of all reef fishes. After 10 months, we removed cages and filmed how free-ranging reef fishes fed among these treatments that differed in algal community structure. In general, Acanthurus spp. and Scarus spp. rapidly grazed exclosure and Sparisoma-only treatments, while Sparisoma spp. preferentially grazed exclosure and Acanthurus-only treatments. These patterns suggest complementarity between Sparisoma spp. and both Acanthurus spp. and Scarus spp. but redundancy between Acanthurus spp. and Scarus spp. Despite these generalities, there was also within-genera variance in response to the different treatments. For example, large Scarus spp., such as Scarus guacamaia, fed more similarly to Sparisoma spp., particularly Sparisoma viride, than to other Scarus spp. Moreover, the three common Sparisoma species differed considerably in the macroalgae to which they exhibited positive or negative relationships. Thus, herbivorous reef fishes vary considerably in their response to different algal communities and exhibit complex patterns of compensatory feeding and functional redundancy that are poorly predicted by taxonomy alone. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The response-and-effect framework is a trait-based approach that seeks to break down the mechanistic links between ecosystem disturbances, species' traits, and ecosystem processes. We apply this framework to a review of the literature on coral reef fish traits, in order to illustrate the research landscape and structure a path forward for the field. Traits were categorized into five broad groupings: behavioral, life history, morphological, diet, and physiological. Overall, there are fewer studies linking effect traits to ecosystem processes (number of papers on herbivory, n = 14; predation, n = 12; bioerosion, n = 2; nutrient cycling, n = 0) than there are linking response traits to disturbances (climate change, n = 26; fishing, n = 20; pollution, n = 4). Through a network analysis, we show that the size and diet of fish are two of the most common response and effect traits currently used in the literature, central to studies on both ecosystem disturbances and processes. Behavioral and life history traits are more commonly shown to respond to disturbances, while morphological traits tend to be used in capturing ecosystem processes. Pearson correlation coefficients quantifying the strength of the relationships between the most commonly studied process, herbivory, and key effect traits (size, gregariousness, and diel activity) are provided. We find that the most popular cluster of traits used in functional diversity metrics (e.g., functional richness, functional dispersion) is comprised of size, diet, space use/position in the water column, diel activity, gregariousness, and mobility, which encompass three of the broad trait categories. Our assessment of the literature highlights that more research is needed to support an evidence-based selection of traits to understand and predict ecosystem functioning. In synthesizing the literature, we identify research gaps and provide an avenue toward a more robust trait-selection process.},

abstract = {We present new data and the first rigorous analysis of latitudinal and thermal gradients of diversity, density and biomass of marine herbivorous fishes and review proposed explanatory mechanisms. Consistently, negative relationships between latitude, and positive relationships between sea surface temperature (SST), and relative richness and relative abundance of herbivorous fishes were found worldwide. Significant differences in the strength of gradients of richness and abundance with latitude and SST between tropical and extratropical zones were found consistently across ocean basins. Standardized sampling along the western Atlantic also showed negative relationships between latitude and total density and biomass. The trends, however, are driven by different components of the fish assemblages (i.e., scarids in the Caribbean and acanthurids in Brazil). Patterns of abundance along thermal gradients, generally associated with extensive latitudinal gradients, also were found at the local scale. Feeding rate of the ocean surgeonfish Acanthurus bahianus decreases with temperature more rapidly than the mean metabolic rate of teleost fishes. This relationship suggests a temperature-related physiological constraint. From the new standardized and comparative data presented and the review of the explanatory hypotheses, we conclude that temperature-related feeding and digestive processes are most likely involved in the distribution patterns of herbivorous fishes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Fish diets provide information that can be used to explore and model complex ecosystems, and infer resource partitioning among species. The exhaustive sampling of prey items captured by each species remains, however, a demanding task. Therefore, predicting diets from other variables, such as functional traits, may be a valuable method. Here, we attempted to predict trophic guild and diet overlap for 35 fish species using 13 ecomorphological traits related to feeding ecology. We compared linear discriminant analysis and random forest (RF) classifiers in their ability to predict trophic guild. We used generalized dissimilarity modelling to predict diet overlap from functional distances between species pairs. All models were evaluated using the same cross-validation procedure. We found that fish trophic guilds were accurately predicted by an RF classifier, even with a limited number of traits, when no more than 7 guilds were defined. Prediction was no longer accurate when finer trophic guilds were created (8 or more guilds), whatever the combination of traits. Furthermore, predicting the degree of diet dissimilarity between species pairs, based on their ecomorphological traits dissimilarities, was profoundly unreliable (at least 76% of unexplained variation). These results suggest that we can predict fish trophic guilds accurately from ecomorphological traits, but not diet overlap and resource partitioning because of inherent versatility in fish diets. More generally, our statistical framework may be applied to any kind of marine organism for which feeding strategies need to be determined from traits. {\textcopyright} 2011 Inter-Research.},

abstract = {Diversity patterns are determined by biogeographic, energetic, and anthropogenic factors, yet few studies have combined them into a large-scale framework in order to decouple and compare their relative effects on fish faunas. Using an empirical dataset derived from 1527 underwater visual censuses (UVC) at 18 oceanic islands (five different marine provinces), we determined the relative influence of such factors on reef fish species richness, functional dispersion, density and biomass estimated from each UVC unit. Species richness presented low variation but was high at large island sites. High functional dispersion, density, and biomass were found at islands with large local species pool and distance from nearest reef. Primary productivity positively affected fish richness, density and biomass confirming that more productive areas support larger populations, and higher biomass and richness on oceanic islands. Islands densely populated by humans had lower fish species richness and biomass reflecting anthropogenic effects. Species richness, functional dispersion, and biomass were positively related to distance from the mainland. Overall, species richness and fish density were mainly influenced by biogeographical and energetic factors, whereas functional dispersion and biomass were strongly influenced by anthropogenic factors. Our results extend previous hypotheses for different assemblage metrics estimated from empirical data and confirm the negative impact of humans on fish assemblages, highlighting the need for conservation of oceanic islands.},

The results supported the hypothesis of differential use of food resources among tropical and higher latitude reef fishes, i.e. the number of species and relative abundance of fishes relying on relatively low-quality food significantly decreased from tropical to temperate latitudes. The species: genus ratio of low-quality food consumers increased toward the tropics, and was higher than the overall ratio considering all fishes in the assemblages. This supports the view that higher speciation rates occurred among this guild of fishes in warm waters. It was also demonstrated that density of herbivorous fishes (the dominant group relying on low-quality food resources) in the western Atlantic decreased from tropical to temperate latitudes. Spatial use and mobility varied with latitude and consequently reef type and complexity. Fishes with small-size home ranges predominated on tropical coral reefs.

abstract = {While marine reserves can replenish local populations of reef fishes exploited by fishermen through enhanced survivorship of post-recruitment fishes, the manner in which reserves enhance larger-scale recruitment to fish stocks is poorly understood. We investigate a metapopulation model to see how marine reserves might help to conserve such populations and benefit fisheries. The model defines two kinds of patches: (i) those open to fishing and (ii) those maintained as reserves free from exploitation. Each patch may occur in one of two states according to whether or not it contains fishes recruited to the fishery. It is shown that reserves become highly beneficial as the local extinction rate caused by fishing becomes large because they provide a source of recruitment into fished-out patches. In such circumstances, the introduction of reserves meets the needs both of conservation and of sustainable exploitation of the fishery. The abundance of the exploitable population is maximized when half of all patches (reserves + exploited patches) are occupied by the stock. The sustainable yield is also maximized when half of all patches are occupied, assuming that yield is proportional to the local extinction rate. This result could provide a rule of thumb for fishery managers addressing the specific question of enhancing recruitment in heavily deleted stocks of certain reef fisheries. However, like other metapopulation models, the one here makes some important simplifying assumptions which would need to be addressed in the application of these results to specific fisheries. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Assessing the effects of environmental constraints on community structure often relies on methods that consider changes in species functional traits in response to environmental processes. Various indices have been proposed to measure relevant aspects of community trait composition from different viewpoints and perspectives. Among these, the 'community-weighted mean trait value' (CWM) and the Rao coefficient have been widely used in ecological research for summarizing different facets of functional composition and diversity. Analyzing changes in functional diversity of bee communities along a post-fire successional gradient in southern Switzerland we show that these two measures may be used to describe two complementary aspects of community structure, such as the mean and the dispersion of functional traits within a given species assemblage. While CWM can be adequately used to summarize shifts in mean trait values within communities due to environmental selection for certain functional traits, the Rao coefficient can be effectively applied to analyze patterns of trait convergence or divergence compared to a random expectation. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Functional redundancy contributes to resilience if different species in the same functional group respond to disturbance in different ways (response diversity). If species in a functional group perform their functional role at different spatial scales (cross-scale redundancy), they are expected to respond differently to scale-specific disturbance. Consequently, variance in the spatial scales over which species perform their functional role may provide a proxy for resilience. Coral reefs are diverse systems that provide key ecosystem services and are subject to increasing anthropogenic disturbances. Algal grazing by herbivorous fish contributes to the maintenance of coral-dominated reefs. To date, there has been little evaluation of the traits driving response diversity among herbivorous fish and how this relates to coral recovery following acute disturbances. Using body size as a proxy for the spatial scale at which fish function, we tested whether cross-scale redundancy in herbivores was an effective indicator of response diversity and coral recovery on 21 reefs monitored through a climate-induced disturbance that caused coral bleaching and widespread coral mortality. When herbivorous fish assemblages that operated over a broader range of spatial scales were present on reefs prior to disturbance, the reefs were more likely to recover to coral-dominated states after the disturbance. After the temperature-induced disturbance, the loss of small herbivores was compensated for through increases in large herbivores. This was indicative of high response diversity and drove the overall increase in herbivore biomass at recovering sites. These compensatory mechanisms were not found at sites where herbivores operated over a narrower range of spatial scales. Synthesis and applications. Cross-scale redundancy provides managers with an indicator of coral reef resilience, although the contribution of cross-scale redundancy to resilience will vary among sites. Maintaining high cross-scale redundancy at a given site requires that no size classes of reef herbivores are disproportionately depleted by fishing. Balanced harvesting, where species are all fished in proportion to their potential production, would help achieve this.},

abstract = {Alterations to ecosystem function due to reductions in species richness are predicted to increase as humans continue to affect the marine environment, especially in coastal areas, which serve as the interface between land and sea. The potential functional consequences due to reductions in species diversity have attracted considerable attention recently but little is known about the consequence of such loss in natural communities. We examined how the potential for function is affected by natural reductions in taxon richness using empirical (non-simulated) coastal marine benthic macrofaunal data from the Skagerrak-Baltic Sea region (N. Europe), where taxon richness decreases 25-fold, from 151 to 6 taxa. To estimate functional changes we defined multiple traits (10 traits and 51 categories) on which trait category richness, functional diversity (FD) and number of taxa per trait category were calculated. Our results show that decrease in taxon richness leads to an overall reduction in function but functional richness remains comparatively high even at the lowest level of taxon richness. Although the taxonomic reduction was sharp, up to 96% of total taxon richness, we identified both potential thresholds in functioning and subtler changes where function was maintained along the gradient. The functional changes were not only caused by reductions in taxa per trait category, some categories were maintained or even increased. Primarily, the reduction in species richness altered trait categories related to feeding, living and movement and thus potentially could have an effect on various ecosystem processes. This highlights the importance of recognising ecosystem multifunctionality, especially at low taxonomic richness. We also found that in this system rare species (singletons) did not stand for the functional complexities and changes. Our findings were consistent with theoretical and experimental predictions and suggest that a large proportion of the information about alterations of function is found in measures such as functional diversity and number of taxa per trait category.},

abstract = {Question: How do multivariate methods perform in relating species- and community-level trait responses to the environment? Location: (1) Field data from grazed semi-natural grasslands, NE Germany; (2) artificial data. Methods: Research questions associated with trait-environment relationships were briefly reviewed and seven available methods evaluated. The main distinction between research questions is whether trait-environment relationships should be addressed at community or species level. A redundancy analysis (RDA) of mean trait values of species in a plot weighted by their abundances (CWM-RDA) is exclusively suitable for the community level. The other six methods address the species level. A double inertia analysis of two arrays (RLQ) and double canonical correspondence analysis (double CCA) use combinations of ordinations to simultaneously analyse species and trait responses to the environment. A combination of the outlying mean index with generalized additive models (OMI-GAM) predicts the response of species to environmental variables on trait gradients. RDA-RegTree first analyses species responses to the environment with RDA and then uses a regression tree to classify trait expressions according to scores of species responses on the ordination axes. Cluster regression uses cluster analyses and logistic regression to search for trait combinations with the best response to the environmental variables. This method models the distribution of functional groups on environmental gradients. All methods and data are available as R scripts. Results: All methods consistently revealed the main trait responses to environment in the field data set, namely that life history was associated with available phosphorus while grazing intensity was related to leaf C:N ratio and canopy height. At community level, CWM-RDA gave a good overview of trait-environment relationships, as also provided by the species-based methods RLQ and double CCA. OMI-GAM revealed non-linear relationships in the field data set. Field and artificial data gave that the number and stability of functional groups produced by Cluster regression and RDA-RegTree varied more strongly than RLQ, double CCA and OMI-GAM. Conclusions: Each method addresses particular ecological concepts and research questions. If a user asks for the response of average trait expressions of communities to environmental gradients, CWM-RDA may be the first choice. However, species-based methods should be applied to address questions regarding co-existence of different life histories or to assess how groups of species respond to environmental changes. The artificial data set revealed that the methods differed in sensitivity to gradient lengths and random data. We compare seven multivariate methods suitable to determine the functional response of species to environmental change. The selection of the most appropriate method depends on the research question, i.e. the response of average trait expressions of communities, the coexistence of different life histories or the response of functional groups. R-scripts and a tutorial for each method are available in the Appendix. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract = {The importance of structural complexity in coral reefs has come to the fore with the global degradation of reef condition; however, the limited scale and replication of many studies have restricted our understanding of the role of complexity in the ecosystem. We qualitatively and quantitatively (where sufficient standardised data were available) assess the literature regarding the role of structural complexity in coral reef ecosystems. A rapidly increasing number of publications have studied the role of complexity in reef ecosystems over the past four decades, with a concomitant increase in the diversity of methods used to quantify structure. Quantitative analyses of existing data indicate a strong negative relationship between structural complexity and algal cover, which may reflect the important role complexity plays in enhancing herbivory by reef fishes. The cover of total live coral and branching coral was positively correlated with structural complexity. These habitat attributes may be creating much of the structure, resulting in a collinear relationship; however, there is also evidence of enhanced coral recovery from disturbances where structural complexity is high. Urchin densities were negatively correlated with structural complexity; a relationship that may be driven by urchins eroding reef structure or by their gregarious behaviour when in open space. There was a strong positive relationship between structural complexity and fish density and biomass, likely mediated through density-dependent competition and refuge from predation. More variable responses were found when assessing individual fish families, with all families examined displaying a positive relationship to structural complexity, but only half of these relationships were significant. Although only corroborated with qualitative data, structural complexity also seems to have a positive effect on two ecosystem services: tourism and shoreline protection. Clearly, structural complexity is an integral component of coral reef ecosystems, and it should be incorporated into monitoring programs and management objectives. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We assess the value chain for nearshore Hawaiian coral reef fisheries, mapping post-catch distribution and disposition, and quantifying associated monetary, food security, and cultural values. We estimate that the total annual value of the nearshore fishery in Hawai‘i is $10.3-$16.4 million, composed of non-commercial ($7.2-$12.9 million) and commercial ($2.97 million licensed + $148,500-$445,500 unlicensed) catch. Hawaii's nearshore fisheries provide >7 million meals annually, with most (>5 million) from the non-commercial sector. Over a third (36%) of meals were planktivores, 26% piscivores, 21% primary consumers, and 18% secondary consumers. Only 62% of licensed commercial catch is accounted for in purchase reports, leaving 38% of landings unreported in sales. Value chains are complex, with major buyers for the commercial fishery including grocery stores (66%), retailers (19%), wholesalers (14%), and restaurants (<1%), who also trade and sell amongst themselves. The bulk of total nearshore catch (72–74%) follows a short value chain, with non-commercial fishers keeping catch for household consumption or community sharing. A small amount (\sim37,000kg) of reef fish—the equivalent of 1.8% of local catch—is imported annually into Hawai‘i, 23,000kg of which arrives as passenger luggage on commercial flights from Micronesia. Evidence of exports to the US mainland exists, but is unquantifiable given existing data. Hawaiian nearshore fisheries support fundamental cultural values including subsistence, activity, traditional knowledge, and social cohesion. These small-scale coral reef fisheries provide large-scale benefits to the economy, food security, and cultural practices of Hawai‘i, underscoring the need for sustainable management. This research highlights the value of information on the value chain for small-scale production systems, making the hidden economy of these fisheries visible and illuminating a range of conservation interventions applicable to Hawai‘i and beyond.},

abstract = {Zooxanthellate corals (i.e. those harbouring Symbiodinium) are the main builders of the world's shallow-water marine coral reefs. They represent intimate diverse symbioses between coral animals, single-celled photosynthetic dinoflagellates (Symbiodinium spp.), other microscopic eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses. Crabs and other crustaceans, worms, sponges, bivalves and hydrozoans, fishes, sea urchins, octopuses and sea stars are itinerant members of these 'rainforests of the sea'. This review focuses on the biodiversity of scleractinian coral animals and their best studied microscopic epi- and endosymbionts. In relation to coral-associated species diversity, Symbiodinium internal transcribed spacer region sequence types tally 102-103 or up to $\sim$15 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs, or putative species at the 97% sequence identity level; this cut-off was chosen based on intragenomic sequence diversity observed in monoclonal cultures) and prokaryotes (mostly bacterial) total 102-104 OTUs. We analysed all publically accessible 16S rRNA gene sequence data and found Gammaproteobacteria were extremely abundant, followed by Alphaproteobacteria. Notably, Archaea were poorly represented and 'unassigned OTUs' were abundant in data generated by high-throughput DNA sequencing studies of corals. We outline and compare model systems that could be used in future studies of the coral holobiont. In our future directions, we recommend a global coral sampling effort including substantial attention being paid to method of coral tissue acquisition, which compartments (mucus, tissue, skeleton) to explore, broadening the holobiont members considered and linking biodiversity with functional investigations.},

abstract = {This Status of Coral Reefs of the World: 2008 report is the 5th global report since the GCRMN (Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network), was formed in 1996 as an operational network of the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI). The catalyst for GCRMN was the inability of international agencies to report objectively on the health or otherwise of the worlds coral reefs. The US government then provided initial funding to set up a global network of coral reef workers to facilitate reporting on reef status; and has continued to be the major supporter of GCRMN and ICRI since the first strategies and action plans were developed in 1995. Each report (1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004) has aimed to present the current status of the worlds coral reefs, the threats to the reefs, and the initiatives being undertaken under the umbrella of ICRI to arrest the decline in the worlds coral reefs. These reports have been produced using the data and information from many coral reef experts around the world. For example 372 experts from 96 countries have contributed to this Status report. Many regional, national and local organisations, governmental, academic, NGO and volunteers have supported the functions of GCRMN. The united goal is to inform the global community on the status of coral reefs, the threats to them and, importantly, to list recommendations to improve coral reef conservation. There is widespread recognition that action is needed urgently, not only to conserve the enormous biodiversity on coral reefs, but also to assist local user communities to improve their livelihoods by ensuring the sustainable use of the reefs.},

Emerging evidence for variability in the coral calcification response to acidification, geographical variation in bleaching susceptibility and recovery, responses to past climate change, and potential rates of adaptation to rapid warming supports an alternative scenario in which reef degradation occurs with greater temporal and spatial heterogeneity than current projections suggest. Reducing uncertainty in projecting coral reef futures requires improved understanding of past responses to rapid climate change; physiological responses to interacting factors, such as temperature, acidification, and nutrients; and the costs and constraints imposed by acclimation and adaptation.},

abstract = {Biological traits offer valuable approaches to understand species distributions and underlying mechanisms. Their use has received a growing interest in marine community ecology, for both fundamental and applied purposes. The need of ecological indicators as part of marine directives and conservation programmes has promoted the use of multiple traits for indicator development, but in a questionable context regarding the state of fundamental developments. Biological Trait Analysis (BTA) is a complex research field, characterised by flexible concepts and applications. In order to enhance the development of relevant marine ecological indicators, this review provides baselines for better theoretical and applied BTA. A compilation of the existing literature reveals that specific topics have dominated the use of multiple traits in marine ecology unlike in freshwater and terrestrial ecology where tests of theories and uses of evolutionary concepts consistently preceded BTA applications. Availability of data sets and analytical techniques seemed to have driven the growing use of marine BTA rather than fundamental questions regarding life history theories in marine ecosystem components and the functional nature of traits. It is therefore suggested that greater focus on life history ecology and on the links between marine species traits and ecosystem functioning are still needed to support trait-based indicator development. Life history strategy understanding is put forward as a theoretically-sound basis and fundamental pre-requisite for trait-based marine indicator development.},

abstract = {1. Interpreting the functional diversity of vegetation is important in unravelling the relationship between environmental change, community composition and ecosystem processes. Functional diversity is the range and distribution of functional trait values in a community. It can be described, among other indicators, by community-level weighted means of trait values (CWM) and functional divergence. Standard methods exist for trait measurements but not for assessments of CWM and functional divergence in the field. No research has addressed the effects of different methods of estimating relative abundances, nor the need to estimate traits at individual, population or species level, or whether methods could be used that bypass taxonomy all together. 2. This study reviews and evaluates plot-level assessment methods of functional diversity in herbaceous vegetation. We asked: (i) Should the objective of the study influence the method for estimating relative abundance? (ii) What are the strengths and limitations of intensive vs. 'rapid' approaches, and when should either be applied? (iii) Are taxon-free methods robust in comparison to taxon-explicit methods of trait measurement? Under what circumstances might they be applied? 3. Our review of published studies that have measured functional diversity in the field showed that the choice of metric has not generally taken into account the link between the metric and the functions of interest, and that vegetation cover has been most widely used, regardless of study purpose. 4. We compared quantitatively in subalpine grasslands three methods for quantification of species abundances plus one taxon-free method. We found that: (i) data base trait values were robust across years for a diverse set of dominant species; (ii) CWM have little sensitivity to method for estimating relative abundances; this sensitivity also depends on traits, for example, seed mass results were less stable than leaf traits and heights; (iii) robust estimates of CWM were obtained from visual estimates of species ranks and biomass using a dry-weight ranking method (BOTANAL), whereas functional divergence was more sensitive to method; and (iv) the taxon-free method should be treated with more caution and performed particularly poorly for estimates of functional divergence. 5. We conclude that methodology can affect estimates of functional diversity. Although care should be taken in the choice of method and interpretation of results, rapid methods often offer promising avenues for sampling larger areas and/or repeated measures. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.},

Given the global nature of these mass coral mortality events, recent studies argue that mitigating climate change is the only path to conserve coral reefs. Using a global analysis of 223 sites, we show that local stressors act synergistically with climate change to kill corals. Local factors such as high abundance of macroalgae or urchins magnified coral loss in the year after bleaching. Notably, the combined effects of increasing heat stress and macroalgae intensified coral loss. Our results offer an optimistic premise that effective local management, alongside global efforts to mitigate climate change, can help coral reefs survive the Anthropocene.},

abstract = {Consumer effects on prey are well known for cascading through food webs and producing dramatic top-down effects on community structure and ecosystem function. Bottom-up effects of prey (primary producer) biodiversity are also well known. However, the role of consumer diversity in affecting community structure or ecosystem function is not well understood. Here, we show that herbivore species richness can be critical for maintaining the structure and function of coral reefs. In two experiments over 2 years, we constructed large cages enclosing single herbivore species, equal densities of mixed species of herbivores, or excluding herbivores and assessed effects on both seaweeds and corals. When compared with single-herbivore treatments, mixed-herbivore treatments lowered macroalgal abundance by 54-76%, enhanced cover of crustose coralline algae (preferred recruitment sites for corals) by 52-64%, increased coral cover by 22%, and prevented coral mortality. Complementary feeding by herbivorous fishes drove the herbivore richness effects, because macroalgae were unable to effectively deter fishes with different feeding strategies. Maintaining herbivore species richness appears critical for preserving coral reefs, because complementary feeding by diverse herbivores produces positive, but indirect, effects on corals, the foundation species for the ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Landscape-scale attributes of patch size, spatial isolation, and topographic complexity are known to influence diversity and abundance in terrestrial and marine systems, but remain collectively untested for reef-building corals. To investigate the relationship between the coral assemblage and seascape variation in reef habitats, we took advantage of the distinct boundaries, spatial configurations, and topographic complexities among artificial reef patches to overcome the difficulties of manipulating natural reefs. Reef size (m2) was found to be the foremost predictor of coral richness in accordance with species-area relationship predictions. Larger reefs were also found to support significantly higher colony densities, enabling us to reject the null hypothesis of random placement (a sampling artifact) in favor of target area predictions that suggest greater rates of immigration on larger reefs. Unlike the pattern previously documented for reef fishes, topographic complexity was not a significant predictor of any coral assemblage response variable, despite the range of complexity values sampled. Lastly, coral colony density was best explained by both increasing reef size and decreasing reef spatial isolation, a pattern found exclusively among brooding species with shorter larval dispersal distances. We conclude that seascape attributes of reef size and spatial configuration within the seascape can influence the species richness and abundance of the coral community at relatively small spatial scales (<1 km). Specifically, we demonstrate how patterns in the coral communities that have naturally established on these manipulated reefs agree with the target area and island biogeography mechanisms to drive species-area relationships in reef-building corals. Based on the patterns documented in artificial reefs, habitat degradation that results in smaller, more isolated natural reefs may compromise coral diversity. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

Achieving this goal requires simplifying this complexity in synthetic axes defining a trait space and to cluster species based on their traits while identifying those with unique combinations of traits. However, so far, we know little about the dimensionality, the robustness to trait omission and the structure of these trait spaces. Here, we propose a unified framework and a synthesis across 30 trait datasets representing a broad variety of taxa, ecosystems and spatial scales to show that a common trade-off between trait space quality and operationality appears between three and six dimensions. The robustness to trait omission is generally low but highly variable among datasets. We also highlight invariant scaling relationships, whatever organismal complexity, between the number of clusters, the number of species in the dominant cluster and the number of unique species with total species richness. When species richness increases, the number of unique species saturates, whereas species tend to disproportionately pack in the richest cluster. Based on these results, we propose some rules of thumb to build species trait spaces and estimate subsequent functional diversity indices.},

abstract = {Functional traits have been fundamental to the evolution and diversification of entire fish lineages on coral reefs. Yet their relationship with the processes promoting speciation, extinction and the filtering of local species pools remains unclear. We review the current literature exploring the evolution of diet, body size, water column use and geographic range size in reef-associated fishes. Using published and new data, we mapped functional traits on to published phylogenetic trees to uncover evolutionary patterns that have led to the current functional diversity of fishes on coral reefs. When examining reconstructed patterns for diet and feeding mode, we found examples of independent transitions to planktivory across different reef fish families. Such transitions and associated morphological alterations may represent cases in which ecological opportunity for the exploitation of different resources drives speciation and adaptation. In terms of body size, reconstructions showed that both large and small sizes appear multiple times within clades of mid-sized fishes and that extreme body sizes have arisen mostly in the last 10 million years (Myr). The reconstruction of range size revealed many cases of disparate range sizes among sister species. Such range size disparity highlights potential vicariant processes through isolation in peripheral locations. When accounting for peripheral speciation processes in sister pairs, we found a significant relationship between labrid range size and lineage age. The diversity and evolution of traits within lineages is influenced by trait–environment interactions as well as by species and trait–trait interactions, where the presence of a given trait may trigger the development of related traits or behaviours. Our effort to assess the evolution of functional diversity across reef fish clades adds to the burgeoning research focusing on the evolutionary and ecological roles of functional traits. We argue that the combination of a phylogenetic and a functional approach will improve the understanding of the mechanisms of species assembly in extraordinarily rich coral reef communities.},

abstract = {Consumers and prey diversity, their interactions, and subsequent effects on ecosystem function are important for ecological processes but not well understood in high diversity ecosystems such as coral reefs. Consequently, we tested the potential for diversity-effects with a series of surveys and experiments evaluating the influence of browsing herbivores on macroalgae in Kenya's fringing reef ecosystem. We surveyed sites and undertook experiments in reefs subject to three levels of human fishing influence: open access fished reefs, small and recently established community-managed marine reserves, and larger, older government- managed marine reserves. Older marine reserves had a greater overall diversity of herbivores and browsers but this was not clearly associated with reduced macroalgal diversity or abundance. Experiments studying succession on hard substrata also found no effects of consumer diversity. Instead, overall browser abundance of either sea urchins or fishes was correlated with declines in macroalgal cover. An exception was that the absence of a key fish browser genus, Naso, which was correlated with the persistence of Sargassum in a marine reserve. Algal selectivity assays showed that macroalgae were consumed at variable rates, a product of strong species-specific feeding and low overlap in the selectivity of browsing fishes. We conclude that the effects of browser and herbivore diversity are less than the influences of key species, whose impacts emerge in different contexts that are influenced by fisheries management. Consequently, identifying key herbivore species and managing to protect them may assist protecting reef functions.},

Next we consider consumers, covering the major reef trophic guilds in the eastern Pacific---suspension feeders, deposit and detritus feeders, herbivores, carnivores (predators and carnivorous grazers), as well as scavengers. The diversity and relative abundance of consumer taxa are described and considered in terms of their ecological roles in community processes. The complex interplay of these guilds is examined through food webs constructed for Panama, Cabo Pulmo reef in the Gulf of California, Mexico, and the Floreana Island rocky reef in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands.

abstract = {In the marine realm, the tropics host an extraordinary diversity of taxa but the drivers underlying the global distribution of marine organisms are still under scrutiny and we still lack an accurate global predictive model. Using a spatial database for 6336 tropical reef fishes, we attempted to predict species richness according to geometric, biogeographical and environmental explanatory variables. In particular, we aimed to evaluate and disentangle the predictive performances of temperature, habitat area, connectivity, mid-domain effect and biogeographical region on reef fish species richness. We used boosted regression trees, a flexible machine-learning technique, to build our predictive model and structural equation modeling to test for potential 'mediation effects' among predictors. Our model proved to be accurate, explaining 80% of the total deviance in fish richness using a cross-validated procedure. Coral reef area and biogeographical region were the primary predictors of reef fish species richness, followed by coast length, connectivity, mid-domain effect and sea surface temperature, with interactions between the region and other predictors. Important indirect effects of water temperature on reef fish richness, mediated by coral reef area, were also identified. The relationship between environmental predictors and species richness varied markedly among biogeographical regions. Our analysis revealed that a few easily accessible variables can accurately predict reef fish species richness. They also highlight concerns regarding ongoing environmental declines, with region-specific responses to variation in environmental conditions predicting a variable response to anthropogenic impacts. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

@article{Hooper2005,
abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

abstract = {Corals and coral-associated species are highly vulnerable to the emerging effects of global climate change. The widespread degradation of coral reefs, which will be accelerated by climate change, jeopardizes the goods and services that tropical nations derive from reef ecosystems. However, climate change impacts to reef social–ecological systems can also be bi-directional. For example, some climate impacts, such as storms and sea level rise, can directly impact societies, with repercussions for how they interact with the environment. This study identifies the multiple impact pathways within coral reef social–ecological systems arising from four key climatic drivers: increased sea surface temperature, severe tropical storms, sea level rise and ocean acidification. We develop a novel framework for investigating climate change impacts in social–ecological systems, which helps to highlight the diverse impacts that must be considered in order to develop a more complete understanding of the impacts of climate change, as well as developing appropriate management actions to mitigate climate change impacts on coral reef and people.},

abstract = {Scientists have advocated for local interventions, such as creating marine protected areas and implementing fishery restrictions, as ways to mitigate local stressors to limit the effects of climate change on reef-building corals. However, in a literature review, we find little empirical support for the notion of managed resilience. We outline some reasons for why marine protected areas and the protection of herbivorous fish (especially parrotfish) have had little effect on coral resilience. One key explanation is that the impacts of local stressors (e.g., pollution and fishing) are often swamped by the much greater effect of ocean warming on corals. Another is the sheer complexity (including numerous context dependencies) of the five cascading links assumed by the managed-resilience hypothesis. If reefs cannot be saved by local actions alone, then it is time to face reef degradation head-on, by directly addressing anthropogenic climate change—the root cause of global coral decline.},

@article{Melo-Merino2020,
abstract = {In recent years, the use of ecological niche models (ENMs) and species distribution models (SDMs) to explore the patterns and processes behind observed distribution of species has experienced an explosive growth. Although the use of these methods has been less common and more recent in marine ecosystems than in a terrestrial context, they have shown significant increases in use and applications. Herein, we provide a systematic review of 328 articles on marine ENMs and SDMs published between 1990 and 2016, aiming to identify their main applications and the diversity of methodological frameworks in which they are developed, including spatial scale, geographic realm, taxonomic groups assessed, algorithms implemented, and data sources. Of the 328 studies, 48 % were at local scales, with a hotspot of research effort in the North Atlantic Ocean. Most studies were based on correlative approaches and were used to answer ecological or biogeographic questions about mechanisms underlying geographic ranges (64 %). A few attempted to evaluate impacts of climate change (19 %) or to develop strategies for conservation (11 %). Several correlative techniques have been used, but most common was the machine-learning approach Maxent (46 %) and statistical approaches such as generalized additive models GAMs (22 %) and generalized linear models, GLMs (14 %). The groups most studied were fish (23 %), molluscs (16 %), and marine mammals (14 %), the first two with commercial importance and the last important for conservation. We noted a lack of clarity regarding the definitions of ENMs versus SDMs, and a rather consistent failure to differentiate between them. This review exposed a need to know, reduce, and report error and uncertainty associated with species' occurrence records and environmental data. In addition, particular to marine realms, a third dimension should be incorporated into the modelling process, referring to the vertical position of the species, which will improve the precision and utility of these models. So too is of paramount importance the consideration of temporal and spatial resolution of environmental layers to adequately represent the dynamic nature of marine ecosystems, especially in the case of highly mobile species.},

abstract = {Multi-use marine protected areas (MUMPAs) are a commonly applied tool for marine conservation in developing countries, particularly where large no-take reserves are not socially or politically feasible. Although MUMPAs have produced benefits around the world, the persistence of moderate fishing pressure reduces the likelihood of achieving the primary objective of these areas, which is the conservation of ecosystems. In this study we used traditional and functional metrics to evaluate how fish assemblages changed through time in a MUMPA, including shifts in species responses and in ecological processes. We conducted visual censuses of fishes at Esp{\'{i}}ritu Santo Island, M{\'{e}}xico (MUMPA; N D320; 24°N, 110°W) from 2005 to 2017 to assess fish richness, size-distribution and density. Three functional indices were calculated using six traits (size, mobility, period of activity, aggregation, position in water column and diet): Functional richness (volume occupied by species), dispersion (complementarity between species) and originality (inverse of functional redundancy). We compared fish diversity among three management zone types (sustainable fishing, traditional fishing and no-take zones), through a 13-year period, assessing which species increased or decreased in occurrence, density, and biomass, and how indices respond over time. Despite a general increase in biomass and stability in density and originality, we detected a reduction in fish biodiversity in the form of declines in species and functional richness, which could imply the risk of local extinction and decrease in certain ecosystem processes. In addition, changes in functional dispersion showed that some functions are losing representation through time. Although no single cause is apparent, such factors as competitive interactions, habitat loss and persistence of fishing pressure potentially explain these decreases. The rise in biomass was associated with a general increase in the average size, rather than increased biomass of commercial species, as the latter remained stable during the study period. Expansion of no-take areas, enforcement of fishing regulations, and surveillance in core zones, should be implemented to reverse the decline in particular species and to promote conservation of fish functional diversity in this MUMPA.},

abstract = {Overexploitation of key species can negatively impact ecosystem processes, so understanding the ecological roles of individual species is critical for improving ecosystem management. Here, we use coral reefs and the process of herbivory as a model to examine how species identity of consumers influence ecosystem processes to inform management of these consumers. Herbivorous fishes can facilitate the recruitment, growth, and recovery of corals by controlling the fast-growing algae that can outcompete corals for space. However, herbivorous fish guilds are species rich with important differences among species in diet, movement, and habitat preferences. Yet, we lack a general understanding of (1) how these species-specific differences in feeding and behavior scale up to reef-wide rates of ecosystem processes and (2) how species identity and diversity impact these processes. To address these knowledge gaps, we used field observations to derive key species- and size-specific foraging parameters for nine herbivorous parrotfish species on coral reefs in the Florida Keys, USA. We then combined these foraging parameters with fish survey data spanning multiple spatial scales to estimate the rates of three ecosystem processes: area of reef grazed, amount of macroalgae removed, and rate of bioerosion. We found that predicted rates of ecological processes varied dramatically among habitats and among reef zones within habitats, driven primarily by variation in abundance among species with different foraging behaviors. In some cases, assemblages with similar levels of total biomass had different rates of ecological processes, and in others, assemblages with different biomass had similar rates of ecological processes. Importantly, our models of herbivory using species-specific parameters differed from those using genus-level parameters by up to 300% in rates of ecological processes, highlighting the importance of herbivore identity in this system. Our results indicate that there may be little overlap in the roles species play, suggesting that some systems may be vulnerable to loss of ecological function with the reduction or loss of just a few species. This work provides a framework that can be applied across the region to predict how changes in management may affect the ecological impact of these important herbivores.},

abstract = {While the ocean has suffered many losses, there is increasing evidence that important progress is being made in marine conservation. Examples include striking recoveries of once-threatened species, increasing rates of protection of marine habitats, more sustainably managed fisheries and aquaculture, reductions in some forms of pollution, accelerating restoration of degraded habitats, and use of the ocean and its habitats to sequester carbon and provide clean energy. Many of these achievements have multiple benefits, including improved human well-being. Moreover, better understanding of how to implement conservation strategies effectively, new technologies and databases, increased integration of the natural and social sciences, and use of indigenous knowledge promise continued progress. Enormous challenges remain, and there is no single solution; successful efforts typically are neither quick nor cheap and require trust and collaboration. Nevertheless, a greater focus on solutions and successes will help them to become the norm rather than the exception.},

abstract = {Functional diversity (FD) has the potential to address many ecological questions, from impacts of global change on biodiversity to ecological restoration. There are several methods estimating the different components of FD. However, most of these methods can only be computed at limited spatial scales and cannot account for intraspecific trait variability (ITV), despite its significant contribution to FD. Trait probability density (TPD) functions (which explicitly account for ITV) reflect the probabilistic nature of niches. By doing so, the TPD approach reconciles existing methods for estimating FD within a unifying framework, allowing FD to be partitioned seamlessly across multiple scales (from individuals to species, and from local to global scales), and accounting for ITV. We present methods to estimate TPD functions at different spatial scales and probabilistic implementations of several FD concepts, including the primary components of FD (functional richness, evenness, and divergence), functional redundancy, functional rarity, and solutions to decompose beta FD into nested and unique components. The TPD framework has the potential to unify and expand analyses of functional ecology across scales, capturing the probabilistic and multidimensional nature of FD. The R package TPD (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=TPD) will allow users to achieve more comparative results across regions and case studies.},

abstract = {Coral reefs worldwide are threatened by thermal stress caused by climate change. Especially devastating periods of coral loss frequently occur during El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events originating in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). El Ni{\~{n}}o-induced thermal stress is considered the primary threat to ETP coral reefs. An increase in the frequency and intensity of ENSO events predicted in the coming decades threatens a pan-tropical collapse of coral reefs. During the 1982–1983 El Ni{\~{n}}o, most reefs in the Galapagos Islands collapsed, and many more in the region were decimated by massive coral bleaching and mortality. However, after repeated thermal stress disturbances, such as those caused by the 1997–1998 El Ni{\~{n}}o, ETP corals reefs have demonstrated regional persistence and resiliency. Using a 44 year dataset (1970–2014) of live coral cover from the ETP, we assess whether ETP reefs exhibit the same decline as seen globally for other reefs. Also, we compare the ETP live coral cover rate of change with data from the maximum Degree Heating Weeks experienced by these reefs to assess the role of thermal stress on coral reef survival. We find that during the period 1970–2014, ETP coral cover exhibited temporary reductions following major ENSO events, but no overall decline. Further, we find that ETP reef recovery patterns allow coral to persist under these El Ni{\~{n}}o-stressed conditions, often recovering from these events in 10–15 years. Accumulative heat stress explains 31% of the overall annual rate of change of living coral cover in the ETP. This suggests that ETP coral reefs have adapted to thermal extremes to date, and may have the ability to adapt to near-term future climate-change thermal anomalies. These findings for ETP reef resilience may provide general insights for the future of coral reef survival and recovery elsewhere under intensifying El Ni{\~{n}}o scenarios.},

abstract = {Biodiversity can influence ecosystem functioning through changes in the amount of resource use complementary among species. Functional diversity is a measure of biodiversity that aims to quantify resource use complementarity and thereby explain and predict ecosystem functioning. The primary goal of this article is to compare the explanatory power of four measures of functional diversity: species richness, functional group richness, functional attribute diversity, and FD. The secondary goal is to showcase the novel methods required for calculating functional attribute diversity and FD. We find that species richness and functional group richness explain the least variation in aboveground biomass production within and across grassland biodiversity manipulations at six European locations; functional attribute diversity and FD explain greater variation. Reasons for differences in explanatory power are discussed, such as the relatively greater amount of information and fewer assumptions included in functional attribute diversity and FD. We explore the opportunities and limitations of the particular methods we used to calculate functional attribute diversity and FD. These mainly concern how best to select the information used to calculate them.},

abstract = {Temperate reefs from around the world are becoming tropicalised, as warm-water species shift their distribution towards the poles in response to warming. This is already causing profound shifts in dominant foundation species and associated ecological communities as canopy seaweeds such as kelp are replaced by tropical species. Here, we argue that the cascading consequences of tropicalisation for the ecosystem properties and functions of warming temperate reefs depend largely on the taxa that end up dominating the seafloor. We put forward three potential tropicalisation trajectories, that differ in whether seaweeds, turf or corals become dominant. We highlight potential gains to certain ecosystem functions for some tropicalisation endpoints. For example, local benthic fish productivity may increase in some tropicalised reefs as a higher proportion of primary production is directly consumed, but this will be at the expense of other functions such as carbon export. We argue that understanding these changes in flows of energy and materials is essential to formulate new conservation strategies and management approaches that minimise risks as well as capture potential opportunities. Regardless of which trajectory is followed, tropicalised systems represent largely novel ecosystem configurations. This poses major challenges to traditional conservation and environmental management approaches, which typically focus on maintaining or returning species to particular locations. We outline management practices that may either mitigate predicted structural and functional changes or make the most of potential new opportunities in tropicalised reefs. These include marine protected areas to increase resilience and connectivity, the development of new fisheries that target range-expanding invaders, and assisted evolution and migration strategies to facilitate the dominance of large habitat formers like corals or seaweeds. We highlight important ecological and ethical challenges associated with developing novel approaches to manage tropicalised reefs, which may need to become increasingly interventionist. As technological innovations continue to emerge, having clear goals and considering the ethics surrounding interventions among the broader community are essential steps to successfully develop novel management approaches.

abstract = {High productivity (maxima ∼3 g C m-2 day-1) of the Eastern Boundary Currents (EBCs), i.e. the California, Peru- Humboldt, Canary and Benguela Currents, is driven by a combination of local forcing and large-scale circulation. The characteristics of the deep water brought to the surface by upwelling favorable winds depend on the large-scale circulation patterns. Here we use a new hydrographic and nutrient climatology together with satellite measurements of the wind vector, sea-surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll concentration, and primary production modeled from ocean color to quantify the meridional and seasonal patterns of upwelling dynamics and biological response. The unprecedented combination of data sets allows us to describe objectively the variability for small regions within each current and to characterize the governing factors for biological production. The temporal and spatial environmental variability was due in most regions to large-scale circulation, alone or in combination with offshore transport (local forcing). The observed meridional and seasonal patterns of biomass and primary production were most highly correlated to components representing large-scale circulation. The biomass sustained by a given nutrient concentration in the Atlantic EBCs was twice as large as that of the Pacific EBCs. This apparent greater efficiency may be due to availability of iron, physical retention, or differences in planktonic community structure. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Portuguese coast has overlapping distributions of species of both boreal and Lusitanian origins; a large number of cold- and warm-water species have their southern or northern distributional range edges here. A latitudinal gradient in ocean climate, particularly sea surface temperature (SST) and primary production, has been described along this coast. Here, we took advantage of this gradient in ocean climate to explore affinities in the biogenic landscape structure of subtidal shallow reefs (the abundance of habitat patches), as well as in the assemblage structure of macroalgae and associated fishes, between each of 3 regions: Viana do Castelo (41.5° N), Peniche (39.2° N) and Sines (37.8° N). Five reefs were sampled to determine the abundance of biogenic habitats and the assemblage structure of macroalgae and fishes in each region. The structure of the landscape, and of macroalgal and fish assemblages, differed between Viana do Castelo and Peniche and between Viana do Castelo and Sines, but not between Peniche and Sines. Viana do Castelo was the only region with conspicuous kelp forests, while Peniche and Sines were dominated by patches of foliose turf-forming and filamentous algae. Our study revealed an abrupt macroecological change from northern Portugal to central and southern Portugal, suggesting a possible biogeographical reconfiguration and recognition of a wider transitional area from the Atlantic into Mediterranean waters. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract = {The fundamental idea behind the study of biodiversity patterns is the presumed connection between the shape of species assemblages and the functional ways in which they are organized, this functional organization referring to how species are related to one another, as competitors or members of a web of interactions and to how species are facing similar environmental constraints. Amongst the different facets of biodiversity, functional diversity is certainly a key for ecosystem processes in coastal areas. However, surprisingly, patterns of functional diversity have received little attention until now. After presenting a common framework linking functional diversity patterns to species coexistence theories, the aim of our study was twofold: (1) to seek assembly rules in brackish lagoon fish communities drove by functional traits. To this aim we used null models to examine the influence of two opposing forces acting on community structure: interspecific competition that might prevent the coexistence of the most similar species, and environmental filters that might result in the most similar species to coexist. (2) To seek relationships between fish functional diversity and environmental gradients, if any. Fish sampling was carried out in two coastal lagoons where stations differ considerably in terms of physicochemical parameters. Using morphological functional traits, functional diversity of fish communities was estimated using two recently published indices as well as a new proposed index. Firstly our study was not able to demonstrate a limitation of similarity in coexisting lagoon fishes due to interspecific competition. Conversely our results support the niche filtering hypothesis preventing species too dissimilar from one another to co-occur at the same station. Secondly, salinity was positively related to the functional diversity of fishes in both lagoons suggesting that within species assemblages near the channel species are less redundant than at stations far from the channel where species tend to be functionally similar (benthic and eating zooplankton). {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Regional differences in species number have puzzled naturalists since the early 1800's, and explanations account for a large part of modern ecological research. Two venerable observations form the cornerstone of our knowledge on the subject: The number of species within a taxonomic group tends to increase with decreasing latitude (see Fischer 1960; Pianka 1966); and the number of species within a taxonomic group tends to increase with increasing area (see Preston 1960, 1962; Williams 1964; MacArthur and Wilson 1967; Simberloff 1972). Despite early research on the latter trend (the species-area relationship), ecologists have studied it intensely only in the last 50 yr. The relationship was originally envisioned as an empirical tool and used in three principle ways: (1) to determine optimal sample size and sample number, (2) to determine the minimum area of a "community," and (3) to predict the number of species in areas larger than those sampled. All three uses are discussed by Kilburn (1966).},

For the global sea surface, we quantified the degree that present climates are disappearing and novel climates (without recent analogs) are emerging, spanning from 1800 through different emission scenarios to 2100. We quantified the sea surface environment based on model estimates of carbonate chemistry and temperature. Between 1800 and 2000, no gridpoints on the ocean surface were estimated to have experienced an extreme degree of global disappearance or novelty. In other words, the majority of environmental shifts since 1800 were not novel, which is consistent with evidence that marine species have been able to track shifting environments via dispersal. However, between 2000 and 2100 under Representative Concentrations Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 projections, 10–82% of the surface ocean is estimated to experience an extreme degree of global novelty. Additionally, 35–95% of the surface ocean is estimated to experience an extreme degree of global disappearance. These upward estimates of climate novelty and disappearance are larger than those predicted for terrestrial systems. Without mitigation, many species will face rapidly disappearing or novel climates that cannot be outpaced by dispersal and may require evolutionary adaptation to keep pace.},

abstract = {Securing ecosystem functions is challenging, yet common priority in conservation efforts. While marine parks aim to meet this challenge by regulating fishing through zoning plans, their effectiveness hinges on compliance levels and may respond to changes in fishing practices. Here we use a speciose assemblage of nominally herbivorous reef fish in Karimunjawa National Park (zoned since 1989) to investigate whether areas subject to a restrictive management regime sustained higher biomass over seven years compared to areas where moderate and permissive regulations apply. Using a trait-based approach we characterize the functional space of the entire species pool and ask whether changes in biomass translate into changes in functional structure. We track changes in predator biomass, benthic community structure, and fishing practices that could influence herbivore trajectories. Overall herbivore biomass doubled in 2012 compared to 2006–2009 and remained high in 2013 across all management regimes. We found no evidence that this biomass build-up resulted from predator depletion or increased food availability but suggest it emerged in response to a park-wide cessation of fishing with large drive nets known as muroami. The biomass increase was accompanied by a modest increase in taxonomic richness and a slight decrease in community-scale rarity that did not alter functional redundancy levels. Subtle changes in both functional specialization and identity of assemblages emerged as generalist species with low intrinsic vulnerability to fishing recovered sooner than more vulnerable specialists. While this implies a recovery of mechanisms responsible for the grazing of algal turfs and detritus, restoring other facets of herbivory (e.g., macroalgal consumption) may require more time. An increase in the cost-benefit ratio per journey of muroami fishing facilitated a ban on muroami nets that met minimal resistance. Similar windows of opportunity may emerge elsewhere in which gear-based regulations can supplement zoning plans, especially when compliance is low. This does not advocate for implementing such regulations once a fishery has become unprofitable. Rather, it underlines their importance for breaking the cycle of resource depletion and low compliance to zoning, thus alleviating the resulting threats to food security and ecosystem integrity.},

abstract = {This paper develops a framework for the study of climate on fish populations based on first principles of physiology, ecology, and available observations. Environmental variables and oceanographic features that are relevant to fish and that are likely to be affected by climate change are reviewed. Working hypotheses are derived from the differences in the expected response of different species groups. A review of published data on Northeast Atlantic fish species representing different biogeographic affinities, habitats, and body size lends support to the hypothesis that global warming results in a shift in abundance and distribution (in patterns of occurrence with latitude and depth) of fish species. Pelagic species exhibit clear changes in seasonal migration patterns related to climate-induced changes in zooplankton productivity. Lusitanian species have increased in recent decades (sprat, anchovy, and horse mackerel), especially at the northern limit of their distribution areas, while Boreal species decreased at the southern limit of their distribution range (cod and plaice), but increased at the northern limit (cod). Although the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain, available evidence suggests climate-related changes in recruitment success to be the key process, stemming from either higher production or survival in the pelagic egg or larval stage, or owing to changes in the quality/quantity of nursery habitats. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Studies linking the functional diversity of a biota to ecosystem functioning typically employ a priori classifications of species into hypothetically complementary groups. However, multiple alternate classifications exist in which the number of functional groups, the number of species per functional group, and the grouping of species differ from the a priori scheme. Without assessing the relative precision, or ability of an a priori scheme to accurately predict ecosystem functioning relative to its many alternatives, the validity and utility of analyses based on a single a priori classification scheme remains unclear. We examine the precision of a priori classifications used in 10 experimental grassland systems in Europe and the United States that have found evidence for a significant role of functional plant diversity in governing ecosystem function. The predictive precision of the a priori classifications employed in these studies was seldom significantly higher than the precision of random classifications. Post-hoc classification schemes that performed well in predicting ecosystem function resembled each other more with regard to species composition than average classifications, but there was still considerable variability in the manner in which these classification schemes grouped species. These results suggest that we need a more nuanced understanding of how the diversity of functional traits of species in an assemblage affects ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Here, we propose a means for quantifying functional diversity that may be particularly useful for determining how functional diversity is related to ecosystem functioning. This measure of functional diversity "FD" is defined as the total branch length of a functional dendrogram. Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional groups in a community. Simulating species' trait values illustrates how the relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness.},

No previous studies have assessed whether forest canopy height shapes the taxonomic and functional diversity of terrestrial vertebrates at global and regional scales. Here, we examine the roles of forest canopy height and other environmental variables in shaping global and regional patterns of species richness and functional diversity of mammals and birds. Location: Global. Time period: Present day. Major taxa studied: Terrestrial mammals and birds. Methods: Global forest canopy height data at 1 km spatial resolution were used to measure forest vertical structure. Species richness, functional richness and functional dispersion of mammals and birds were calculated using range maps and trait data. Spatial simultaneous autoregressive error models were used to evaluate associations between species richness and functional diversity and their predictors, including mean canopy height, standard deviation of canopy height, net primary productivity, current climate and historical climate stability, topography and human activities. Results: Mean canopy height emerged as one of two predictors most associated with species richness of mammals and birds as well as mammal functional richness. However, mean canopy height had little explanatory power for functional dispersion. Mean annual temperature and net primary productivity contributed most to explain global-scale mammal and bird functional dispersion. At the regional scale, mean canopy height, net primary productivity and mean annual temperature were the variables most associated with the species richness and functional diversity of mammals and birds. Main conclusions: Forest canopy height is an important predictor of species richness and functional diversity of terrestrial vertebrates at both global and regional scales, at a similar overall level to productivity and temperature. Our study highlights the crucial role of the complex vertical structure in shaping the global and regional patterns of vertebrate diversity.},

abstract = {Due to climate change, coral reefs have experienced mass bleaching, and mortality events in recent years. Although coral reefs are unlikely to persist in their current form unless climate change can be addressed, local management can have a role to play by extending the time frame over which there are functional reef systems capable of recovery. Here we consider the potential application of one form of local management – management of herbivorous fishes. The premise behind this approach is that increased herbivory could shift reef algal assemblages to states that are benign or beneficial for corals, thereby increasing corals' ability to recover from destructive events such as bleaching and to thrive in periods between events. With a focus on Indo-Pacific coral reefs, we review what is known about the underlying processes of herbivory and coral-algal competition that ultimately affect the ability of corals to grow, persist, and replenish themselves. We then critically assess evidence of effectiveness or otherwise of herbivore management within marine protected areas (MPAs) to better understand why many MPAs have not improved outcomes for corals, and more importantly to identify the circumstances in which that form of management would be most likely to be effective. Herbivore management is not a panacea, but has the potential to enhance coral reef persistence in the right circumstances. Those include that: (i) absent management, there is an “algal problem” – i.e., insufficient herbivory to maintain algae in states that are benign or beneficial for corals; and (ii) management actions are able to increase net herbivory. As increased corallivory is a potentially widespread negative consequence of management, we consider some of the circumstances in which that is most likely to be a problem as well as potential solutions. Because the negative effects of certain algae are greatest for coral settlement and early survivorship, it may be that maintaining sufficient herbivory is particularly important in promoting recovery from destructive events such as mass bleaching. Thus, herbivore management can have a role to play as part of a wider strategy to manage and reduce the threats that currently imperil coral reefs.},

abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clarified how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reflect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual unification across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a fixed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on flows of energy and matter. These findings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

Here, we describe the chasm that has developed between ecology and historical biogeography, some of the important questions that have fallen into it and how it might be bridged.

abstract = {There have been five Mass Extinction events in the history of Earth's biodiversity, all caused by dramatic but natural phenomena. It has been claimed that the Sixth Mass Extinction may be underway, this time caused entirely by humans. Although considerable evidence indicates that there is a biodiversity crisis of increasing extinctions and plummeting abundances, some do not accept that this amounts to a Sixth Mass Extinction. Often, they use the IUCN Red List to support their stance, arguing that the rate of species loss does not differ from the background rate. However, the Red List is heavily biased: almost all birds and mammals but only a minute fraction of invertebrates have been evaluated against conservation criteria. Incorporating estimates of the true number of invertebrate extinctions leads to the conclusion that the rate vastly exceeds the background rate and that we may indeed be witnessing the start of the Sixth Mass Extinction. As an example, we focus on molluscs, the second largest phylum in numbers of known species, and, extrapolating boldly, estimate that, since around AD 1500, possibly as many as 7.5–13% (150,000–260,000) of all $\sim$2 million known species have already gone extinct, orders of magnitude greater than the 882 (0.04%) on the Red List. We review differences in extinction rates according to realms: marine species face significant threats but, although previous mass extinctions were largely defined by marine invertebrates, there is no evidence that the marine biota has reached the same crisis as the non-marine biota. Island species have suffered far greater rates than continental ones. Plants face similar conservation biases as do invertebrates, although there are hints they may have suffered lower extinction rates. There are also those who do not deny an extinction crisis but accept it as a new trajectory of evolution, because humans are part of the natural world; some even embrace it, with a desire to manipulate it for human benefit. We take issue with these stances. Humans are the only species able to manipulate the Earth on a grand scale, and they have allowed the current crisis to happen. Despite multiple conservation initiatives at various levels, most are not species oriented (certain charismatic vertebrates excepted) and specific actions to protect every living species individually are simply unfeasible because of the tyranny of numbers. As systematic biologists, we encourage the nurturing of the innate human appreciation of biodiversity, but we reaffirm the message that the biodiversity that makes our world so fascinating, beautiful and functional is vanishing unnoticed at an unprecedented rate. In the face of a mounting crisis, scientists must adopt the practices of preventive archaeology, and collect and document as many species as possible before they disappear. All this depends on reviving the venerable study of natural history and taxonomy. Denying the crisis, simply accepting it and doing nothing, or even embracing it for the ostensible benefit of humanity, are not appropriate options and pave the way for the Earth to continue on its sad trajectory towards a Sixth Mass Extinction.},

The spatial and temporal trends of functional diversity exploited from the LMEs were calculated using global reconstructed marine fisheries catch data provided by the Sea Around Us initiative (including subsistence, artisanal, recreational, industrial fisheries, and discards) and functional trait data available in FishBase. Our analyses uncovered a substantial increase in the functional richness of both ray-finned fishes (80{\%} of LMEs) and cartilaginous species (sharks and rays) (75{\%} of LMESs), in line with an increase in the taxonomic richness, extracted from these ecosystems. The functional evenness and functional divergence of these catches have also altered substantially over the time span of this study, with considerable geographic variation in the patterns detected. These trends show that global fisheries are increasingly targeting species that play diverse roles within the marine ecosystem and underline the importance of incorporating functional diversity in ecosystem management.},

Next we consider consumers, covering the major reef trophic guilds in the eastern Pacific---suspension feeders, deposit and detritus feeders, herbivores, carnivores (predators and carnivorous grazers), as well as scavengers. The diversity and relative abundance of consumer taxa are described and considered in terms of their ecological roles in community processes. The complex interplay of these guilds is examined through food webs constructed for Panama, Cabo Pulmo reef in the Gulf of California, Mexico, and the Floreana Island rocky reef in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands.

These methodological hurdles have stymied progress in managing this critical coral reef function, potentially jeopardising the future of many small-scale tropical fisheries struggling to respond to global changes. Here, we summarise the physiological and ecological processes that lead to the production of fish biomass. We outline principles and present a robust framework for quantifying fish productivity in high-diversity ecosystems that overcomes these shortcomings by integrating readily accessible individual-level data (e.g. from visual counts) with growth trajectories and predicted mortality rates. This framework provides fisheries-independent estimates of multispecies fish productivity without the need to specify often unknown detailed trophic relationships. We delineate five simple steps and provide a critical user-friendly interface (an easy-to-use R package) to make the calculation of fish productivity a readily accessible tool for coral reef scientists and managers.},

The grazing capacity of these fishes could be impaired if marine reserves achieve their long-term goal of restoring large consumers, several of which prey on parrotfishes. Here we compare the negative impacts of enhanced predation with the positive impacts of reduced fishing mortality on parrotfishes inside reserves. Because large-bodied parrotfishes escape the risk of predation from a large piscivore (the Nassau grouper), the predation effect reduced grazing by only 4 to 8%. This impact was overwhelmed by the increase in density of large parrotfishes, resulting in a net doubling of grazing. Increased grazing caused a fourfold reduction in the cover of macroalgae, which, because they are the principal competitors of corals, highlights the potential importance of reserves for coral reef resilience.},

abstract = {Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds readers' knowledge of and confidence in statistical modeling. Reflecting the need for even minor programming in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work. The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation. By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling. Web Resource The book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author's website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas.},

abstract = {The assumption that parrotfishes represent a single group of grazing herbivores is addressed by morphological, functional and ecological analyses. This assumption is rejected. The 24 scarine parrotfishes from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, are divided into two functional groups: excavators and scrapers. The osteology and myology of the jaws of all 24 species were examined, and a detailed description of a representative species from each group is provided. The relative weights of the major jaw structures of five representative species were quantified. Morphological differences between species were interpreted in a functional context and were assessed based on observations of feeding in the field. Species in the two functional groups show major group-related differences in their bite speeds, microhabitat utilization patterns, and form and extent of substratum excavation during grazing. Group-related differences are also apparent in feeding rates, foray sizes and bite rates. The division of the species into two functional groups is supported by both morphological and behavioural observations. The ecological significance of two functional groups within the family is discussed in relation to the role of parrotfishes on reefs, particularly in terms of bioerosion. {\textcopyright} 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {We propose an integrated sampling, rarefaction, and extrapolation methodology to compare species richness of a set of communities based on samples of equal completeness (as measured by sample coverage) instead of equal size. Traditional rarefaction or extrapolation to equal-sized samples can misrepresent the relationships between the richnesses of the communities being compared because a sample of a given size may be sufficient to fully characterize the lower diversity community, but insufficient to characterize the richer community. Thus, the traditional method systematically biases the degree of differences between community richnesses. We derived a new analytic method for seamless coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation. We show that this method yields less biased comparisons of richness between communities, and manages this with less total sampling effort. When this approach is integrated with an adaptive coverage-based stopping rule during sampling, samples may be compared directly without rarefaction, so no extra data is taken and none is thrown away. Even if this stopping rule is not used during data collection, coveragebased rarefaction throws away less data than traditional size-based rarefaction, and more efficiently finds the correct ranking of communities according to their true richnesses. Several hypothetical and real examples demonstrate these advantages. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {The fishing down of marine food webs has been described in pelagic and demersal systems but rarely documented in coral reef environments. We recorded a rapid shift in fish community structure in Belize that accompanied a marked decline in grouper and snapper abundance and a switch towards smaller, less desirable, herbivorous parrotfishes. In a 6 to 7 yr period (2002-2008/09), observations of large-bodied grouper (Serranidae) declined significantly from an encounter probability of 21% per 200 m2 transect to just 2%. The biomass of carnivorous snappers (Lutjanidae) underwent a 7-fold decline, primarily in the species Ocyurus chrysurus. During this period, the inclusion of parrotfish in fish catches at nearby Glover's Atoll increased from a frequency of 6% in 2004 to ∼20% of speared individuals by 2008. Parrotfish biomass declined by 41% between 2002 and 2008/09, with a major decline in the large and dominant herbivore Sparisoma viride. No changes in parrotfish biomass were detectable in nearby marine reserves during this time. Several important indirect effects of fishing were observed. The biomass of mesopredators including Cephalopholis fulvus, C. cruentatus, and Epinephelus guttatus increased dramatically by 880% as compared to the 2002 levels. We putatively attribute this response to a release from predation and constraints to foraging behaviour imposed by large serranids. Further, we find that the density of adult damselfish of the species Stegastes planifrons and S. partitus decreased by ∼45%. We attribute this decline to elevated predation by the increased densities of mesopredators, which have been shown to prey upon juvenile damselfish. No change in damselfish densities was found at 2 control locations where fishing was prohibited. The decline in parrotfish in the central Mesoamerican barrier reef likely accounts for recent anecdotal observations of Halimeda tuna spreading to microhabitats that have previously been grazed intensively. While these results imply that the resilience of these reefs may be seriously impaired, the Belize Government has recently enacted new legislation to improve the management of grouper and outlaw harvesting of most herbivorous fish. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are in crisis worldwide. Fish play a key role in the resilience of reefs because most of the biomass of the ecosystem flows through them. Evidence indicates that the response to stressors will vary markedly depending on the resilience of the ecosystem. In order to assess the functional groups of reef fishes, morphometric and ecomorphological analyses were carried out on the shape and diet of 117 reef fish species from the Mexican Eastern Pacific (MEP) from 23°N to 15°N, spanning the years 2009-2012. Six trophic groups were identified and subdivided into 19 functional groups: (A) detritus and plants consumers, three morphologies; (B) plants and zoobenthos consumers, four morphologies; (C) zoobenthos consumers, two morphologies; (D) zoobenthos and zooplankton consumers, three morphologies; (E) zooplankton and nekton consumers, three morphologies; and (F) nekton consumers, four morphologies. Our main conclusions are: (i) fish communities of the MEP have a high degree of ecological redundancy; (ii) fish diversity is not related to the coral cover; and (iii) the combination of using both morphology and diet produce a more effective classification of functional groups. Future studies such as these will allow a deeper understanding of environment and it will help illuminate the effects of fish morphology and diet on population structure.},

Here, we show that climate change will overwhelm current local-scale refugia, with declines in global thermal refugia from 84% of global coral reef pixels in the present-day climate to 0.2% at 1.5°C, and 0% at 2.0°C of global warming. Local-scale oceanographic features such as upwelling and strong ocean currents only rarely provide future thermal refugia. We confirm that warming of 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels will be catastrophic for coral reefs. Focusing management efforts on thermal refugia may only be effective in the short-term. Promoting adaptation to higher temperatures and facilitating migration will instead be needed to secure coral reef survival.},

abstract = {Aim We aimed to redress a current limitation of local ecological studies (i.e. piecemeal information on specific taxa) by integrating existing ecological knowledge with quantifiable patterns in primary habitat (i.e. composition, distribution and cover) from local to continental scales. By achieving this aim, we sought to provide a biogeographical framework for the interpretation of variation in the ecology of, and threats to, subtidal rocky landscapes. Location The subtidal rocky coast of continental Australia, with longitudinal comparisons spanning > 4000 km of southern coast (115?03' E-153?60/ E) between latitudes of 33?05/ S and 35?36' S, and latitudinal comparisons across 26?40' S to 37?08/ S of eastern Australia. Methods The frequency and size of patches of major benthic habitat were quantified to indicate contemporary function (ecology) and to establish patterns that may result from contrasting regional-scale processes (biogeography). This was achieved by quantifying the composition and patchiness of key subtidal habitats across the continent and relating them to the known ecology of subsets of locations in each region. A nested design of several spatial scales (1000s, 100s, 10-1 km) was adopted to distinguish patterns at local through to biogeographical scales. Results We show biogeography (in terms of longitude and latitude) to have a fundamental influence on the patterns of abundance and composition of subtidal habitats across regional (1000s of kilometres) to local (10s of kilometres to metres) scales. Across the continent, the most fundamental patterns related to (1) the proportion of rock covered by kelp forests, as related to particular functional groups of herbivores, and (2) the small-scale heterogeneity (metres) that characterizes these forests. Main conclusions We interpret these results within a framework of alternative processes known to maintain habitat heterogeneity across these regions (e.g. productivity versus consumption as shapers of habitat structure). These interpretations illustrate how regional differences in ecological patterns and processes can create contradictory outcomes for the management of natural resources. We suggest that researchers and managers of natural resources alike may benefit from understanding local issues (e.g. the effects of fishing},

abstract = {Tropical coral reefs currently face an unprecedented restructuring since their extant form and function emerged $\sim$24 million years ago in the early Neogene. They have entered the Anthropocene—an epoch where humans have become the dominant force of planetary change. Human impacts on and interactions with coral reefs are escalating across multiple trophic levels and scales, but we have a rudimentary understanding of what this means for their functional ecology. The overall goal of this special feature is to unpack what the Anthropocene means for the functional ecology of coral reefs, laying the foundations for new approaches and research directions in coral reef science. The collection describes the functional changes and novel dynamics that characterise Anthropocene reefs, from variations in their taxonomy and geology through to the resulting shifts in ecosystem services they provide to humanity. Common changes to coral reefs are occurring that are challenging their historical functional role. These include reductions in benthic calcifiers and declining carbonate production, and benthic assemblage shifts leading to a loss of structural complexity and flattening of reef seascapes. As reefs as we know them are lost from some locations, range extensions and the “tropicalisation” of temperate locations present novel ecosystem configurations that are challenging ecological paradigms and our historical approach to ecosystem management. Hindering our progress, however, is a “functionality crisis.” Coral reef functional ecology to date has lacked a clear and universal definition of the term “function,” and many assumed links between taxa and reef processes lack empirical evidence. Moving forward, we must establish causal links between functional traits, the species that possess them, and specific ecosystem processes if we are to successfully manage Anthropocene reefs. The functional space coral reefs occupy has arguably widened, presenting ethical challenges surrounding the increasingly interventionist management practices required to achieve particular functional endpoints. For us to steer coral reefs towards a desirable functional future will require a more mechanistic understanding between ecosystem attributes and the provision of services, acknowledging that such services are coproduced by the ecosystem and society. Ultimately, this era in coral reef ecology requires a new approach to coral reef science, one that addresses the complex socio-ecological nature of coral reefs. These works outline a path ahead for defining and studying the functional ecology of coral reefs, drive debate as to what we want their functional future to look like and call for ecosystem function to be at the heart of managing coral reef futures during this period of rapid transition.},

abstract = {In Chapter 1, we treated probabilities, graphs, and structural equations as isolated mathematical objects with little to connect them. But the three are, in fact, closely linked. In this chapter, we show that the concept of independence, which in the language of probability is defined by algebraic equalities, can be expressed visually using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Further, this graphical representation will allow us to capture the probabilistic information that is embedded in a structural equation model. The net result is that a researcher who has scientific knowledge in the form of a structural equation model is able to predict patterns of independencies in the data, based solely on the structure of the model's graph, without relying on any quantitative information carried by the equations or by the distributions of the errors. Conversely, it means that observing patterns of independencies in the data enables us to say something about whether a hypothesized model is correct. Ultimately, as we will see in Chapter 3, the structure of the graph, when combined with data, will enable us to predict quantitatively the results of interventions without actually performing them. 2.2 Chains and Forks We have so far referred to causal models as representations of the "causal story" underlying data. Another way to think of this is that causal models represent the mechanism by which data were generated. Causal models are a sort of blueprint of the relevant part of the universe, and we can use them to simulate data from this universe. Given a truly complete causal model for, say, math test scores in high school juniors, and given a complete list of values for every exogenous variable in that model, we could theoretically generate a data point (i.e., a test score) for any individual. Of course, this would necessitate specifying all factors that may have an effect on a student's test score, an unrealistic task. In most cases, we will not have such precise knowledge about a model. We might instead have a probability distribution characterizing the exogenous},

abstract = {A priority for modern conservation is finding and managing regions with environmental and biodiversity portfolio characteristics that will promote adaptation and the persistence of species during times of rapid climate change. The latitudinal edges of high-diversity biomes are likely to provide a mixture of environmental gradients and biological diversity that meet the portfolio criteria needed for adaptive systems. Northern Mozambique and the Quirimbas Islands represent the edge of a coral reef diversity center with limited potential to expand because of geologic and oceanographic limits on the southern edges. This region does, however, have the potential to be its own discrete adaptive center if it contains climate refugia and there are environmental gradients that promote acclimatization, ecological reorganization, and natural selection. Consequently, to evaluate this potential we tested for strong regional environmental spatial heterogeneity that might indicate a climate-adaptive center. Additionally, we evaluated human influences and environmental and demographic data on finfish, coral, and sea urchins in 66 reefs across ∼4° of latitude to evaluate ecological changes and human threats. A number of clear gradients in environmental and human influences were observed. For example, temperature increased and became more centralized and right-skewed, while water quality decreased to the south. Coral communities susceptible to thermal stress were found in the north where dispersed temperatures indicated a location with either tolerance to or refugium from recent thermal disturbances. Nevertheless, high coral diversity was found in southern deep-water channels. Further, spatial patterns for corals and fish differed indicating complex geographicfishing-biodiversity gradients. Consequently, environmental conditions for an adaptive portfolio exist and include refugia for preserving climate-sensitive and for numbers of coral taxa. Fishing and urban threats were observable as reduced fish biomass, diversity, and body sizes but higher biomass of sea urchins. We observed that many remote and protected areas had fish biomass values lower than expected or near maximum sustainable yields. This indicates low compliance and widespread migratory fishing, which is reducing fish diversity below maximum levels. Recommendations to sustain this adaptive center are to maintain fish biomass {\textgreater}500 kg/ha by increasing fisheries restrictions and compliance.},

abstract = {When tropical systems lose species, they are often assumed to be buffered against declines in functional diversity by the ability of the species-rich biota to display high functional redundancy: i.e., a high number of species performing similar functions. We tested this hypothesis using a ninefold richness gradient in global fish faunas on tropical reefs encompassing 6,316 species distributed among 646 functional entities (FEs): i.e., unique combinations of functional traits. We found that the highest functional redundancy is located in the Central Indo-Pacific with a mean of 7.9 species per FE. However, this overall level of redundancy is disproportionately packed into few FEs, a pattern termed functional over-redundancy (FOR). For instance, the most speciose FE in the Central Indo-Pacific contains 222 species (out of 3,689) whereas 38% of FEs (180 out of 468) have no functional insurance with only one species. Surprisingly, the level of FOR is consistent across the six fish faunas, meaning that, whatever the richness, over a third of the species may still be in overrepresented FEs whereas more than one third of the FEs are left without insurance, these levels all being significantly higher than expected by chance. Thus, our study shows that, even in high-diversity systems, such as tropical reefs, functional diversity remains highly vulnerable to species loss. Although further investigations are needed to specifically address the influence of redundant vs. vulnerable FEs on ecosystem functioning, our results suggest that the promised benefits from tropical biodiversity may not be as strong as previously thought.},

abstract = {Coral reefs are among the most biodiverse and productive ecosystems on Earth, and provide critical ecosystem services such as protein provisioning, coastal protection, and tourism revenue. Despite these benefits, coral reefs have been declining precipitously across the globe due to human impacts and climate change. Recent efforts to combat these declines are increasingly turning to restoration to help reseed corals and speed- up recovery processes. Coastal restoration theory and practice has historically favored transplanting designs that reduce potentially harmful negative species interactions, such as competition between transplants. However, recent research in salt marsh ecosystems has shown that shifting this theory to strategically incorporate positive interactions significantly enhances restoration yield with little additional cost or investment. Although some coral restoration efforts plant corals in protected areas in order to benefit from the facilitative effects of herbivores that reduce competitive macroalgae, little systematic effort has been made in coral restoration to identify the entire suite of positive interactions that could promote population enhancement efforts. Here, we highlight key positive species interactions that managers and restoration practitioners should utilize to facilitate the restoration of corals, including (i) trophic facilitation, (ii) mutualisms, (iii) long-distance facilitation, (iv) positive density-dependence, (v) positive legacy effects, and (vi) synergisms between biodiversity and ecosystem function. As live coral cover continues to decline and resources are limited to restore coral populations, innovative solutions that increase efficiency of restoration efforts will be critical to conserving and maintaining healthy coral reef ecosystems and the human communities that rely on them.},

Herbivory was estimated by assay and biomass methods, and both methods indicated higher herbivory in fishery closures. Despite higher herbivory, the effect of the ENSO disturbance was larger within these closures, with reefs undergoing a temporary transition from dominance by hard and soft coral to a temporary dominance of turf and erect algae that ended in the dominance of calcifying algae, massive Porites, Pocillopora and a few faviids six years after the disturbance. The fished reefs changed the least but had a greater cover of turf and erect algae and sponge shortly after the disturbance. Higher herbivory in the fishery closures reduced the abundance and persistence of herbivore-susceptible erect algae and created space and appropriate substratum for recruiting corals. Nonetheless, other post-settlement processes may have had strong influences such that annual rates of coral recovery were low (∼2%) and not different between the management regimes. Recovery, as defined as and measured by the return to pre-disturbance coral cover and the dominant taxa, was slower in fishery closures than unmanaged reefs. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen.

abstract = {Recent episodes of coral bleaching have led to wide-scale loss of reef corals and raised concerns over the effectiveness of existing conservation and management efforts. The 1998 bleaching event was most severe in the western Indian Ocean, where coral declined by up to 90% in some locations. Using fisheries-independent data, we assessed the long-term impacts of this event on fishery target species in the Seychelles, the overall size structure of the fish assemblage, and the effectiveness of two marine protected areas (MPAs) in protecting fish communities. The biomass of fished species above the size retained in fish traps changed little between 1994 and 2005, indicating no current effect on fishery yields. Biomass remained higher in MPAs, indicating they were effective in protecting fish stocks. Nevertheless, the size structure of the fish communities, as described with size-spectra analysis, changed in both fished areas and MPAs, with a decline in smaller fish (<30 cm) and an increase in larger fish (>45 cm). We believe this represents a time-lag response to a reduction in reef structural complexity brought about because fishes are being lost through natural mortality and fishing, and are not being replaced by juveniles. This effect is expected to be greater in terms of fisheries productivity and, because congruent patterns are observed for herbivores, suggests that MPAs do not offer coral reefs long-term resilience to bleaching events. Corallivores and planktivores declined strikingly in abundance, particularly in MPAs, and this decline was associated with a similar pattern of decline in their preferred corals. We suggest that climate-mediated disturbances, such as coral bleaching, be at the fore of conservation planning for coral reefs. {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {We present new data and the first rigorous analysis of latitudinal and thermal gradients of diversity, density and biomass of marine herbivorous fishes and review proposed explanatory mechanisms. Consistently, negative relationships between latitude, and positive relationships between sea surface temperature (SST), and relative richness and relative abundance of herbivorous fishes were found worldwide. Significant differences in the strength of gradients of richness and abundance with latitude and SST between tropical and extratropical zones were found consistently across ocean basins. Standardized sampling along the western Atlantic also showed negative relationships between latitude and total density and biomass. The trends, however, are driven by different components of the fish assemblages (i.e., scarids in the Caribbean and acanthurids in Brazil). Patterns of abundance along thermal gradients, generally associated with extensive latitudinal gradients, also were found at the local scale. Feeding rate of the ocean surgeonfish Acanthurus bahianus decreases with temperature more rapidly than the mean metabolic rate of teleost fishes. This relationship suggests a temperature-related physiological constraint. From the new standardized and comparative data presented and the review of the explanatory hypotheses, we conclude that temperature-related feeding and digestive processes are most likely involved in the distribution patterns of herbivorous fishes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The diversity of life on our planet has produced a remarkable variety of biological traits that characterize different species. Such traits are widely employed instead of taxonomy to increase our understanding of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. However, for species' trophic niches, one of the most critical aspects of organismal ecology, a paucity of empirical information has led to inconsistent definitions of trophic guilds based on expert opinion. Using coral reef fishes as a model, we show that experts often disagree on the assignment of trophic guilds for the same species. Even when broad categories are assigned, 60% of the evaluated trait schemes disagree on the attribution of trophic categories for at least 20% of the species. This disagreement greatly hampers comparability across studies. Here, we introduce a quantitative, unbiased, and fully reproducible framework to define species' trophic guilds based on empirical data. First, we synthesize data from community-wide visual gut content analysis of tropical coral reef fishes, resulting in trophic information from 13,961 individuals belonging to 615 reef fish species across all ocean basins. We then use network analysis to cluster the resulting global bipartite food web into distinct trophic guilds, resulting in eight trophic guilds, and employ a Bayesian phylogenetic model to predict trophic guilds based on phylogeny and maximum body size. Our model achieved a misclassification error of 5%, indicating that our approach results in a quantitative and reproducible trophic categorization scheme, which can be updated as new information becomes available. Although our case study is for reef fishes, the most diverse vertebrate consumer group, our approach can be applied to other organismal groups to advance reproducibility in trait-based ecology. As such, our work provides an empirical and conceptual advancement for trait-based ecology and a viable approach to monitor ecosystem functioning in our changing world.},

abstract = {We propose an integrated sampling, rarefaction, and extrapolation methodology to compare species richness of a set of communities based on samples of equal completeness (as measured by sample coverage) instead of equal size. Traditional rarefaction or extrapolation to equal-sized samples can misrepresent the relationships between the richnesses of the communities being compared because a sample of a given size may be sufficient to fully characterize the lower diversity community, but insufficient to characterize the richer community. Thus, the traditional method systematically biases the degree of differences between community richnesses. We derived a new analytic method for seamless coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation. We show that this method yields less biased comparisons of richness between communities, and manages this with less total sampling effort. When this approach is integrated with an adaptive coverage-based stopping rule during sampling, samples may be compared directly without rarefaction, so no extra data is taken and none is thrown away. Even if this stopping rule is not used during data collection, coveragebased rarefaction throws away less data than traditional size-based rarefaction, and more efficiently finds the correct ranking of communities according to their true richnesses. Several hypothetical and real examples demonstrate these advantages. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {A priority for modern conservation is finding and managing regions with environmental and biodiversity portfolio characteristics that will promote adaptation and the persistence of species during times of rapid climate change. The latitudinal edges of high-diversity biomes are likely to provide a mixture of environmental gradients and biological diversity that meet the portfolio criteria needed for adaptive systems. Northern Mozambique and the Quirimbas Islands represent the edge of a coral reef diversity center with limited potential to expand because of geologic and oceanographic limits on the southern edges. This region does, however, have the potential to be its own discrete adaptive center if it contains climate refugia and there are environmental gradients that promote acclimatization, ecological reorganization, and natural selection. Consequently, to evaluate this potential we tested for strong regional environmental spatial heterogeneity that might indicate a climate-adaptive center. Additionally, we evaluated human influences and environmental and demographic data on finfish, coral, and sea urchins in 66 reefs across ∼4° of latitude to evaluate ecological changes and human threats. A number of clear gradients in environmental and human influences were observed. For example, temperature increased and became more centralized and right-skewed, while water quality decreased to the south. Coral communities susceptible to thermal stress were found in the north where dispersed temperatures indicated a location with either tolerance to or refugium from recent thermal disturbances. Nevertheless, high coral diversity was found in southern deep-water channels. Further, spatial patterns for corals and fish differed indicating complex geographicfishing-biodiversity gradients. Consequently, environmental conditions for an adaptive portfolio exist and include refugia for preserving climate-sensitive and for numbers of coral taxa. Fishing and urban threats were observable as reduced fish biomass, diversity, and body sizes but higher biomass of sea urchins. We observed that many remote and protected areas had fish biomass values lower than expected or near maximum sustainable yields. This indicates low compliance and widespread migratory fishing, which is reducing fish diversity below maximum levels. Recommendations to sustain this adaptive center are to maintain fish biomass >500 kg/ha by increasing fisheries restrictions and compliance.},

abstract = {To define the functional groups of fish and macroinvertebrates in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), visual censuses were performed in 18 areas of four biogeographic provinces: Cort{\'{e}}s, Mexican, Panamic and Oceanic Islands. A total of 257 fish and macroinvertebrate species were recorded, and from them, 27 morpho-functional groups (MFGs) were constructed on the basis of trophic level, maximum size, taxonomy and morphology. Biomass, richness, diversity and evenness of MFGs were calculated for each province and compared statistically; a regression analysis between taxonomic and functional diversity was conducted to observe the relationship between these two indicators. There were significant differences in all ecological indices (p <.002), highlighting the high biomass and richness of MFGs in the Cort{\'{e}}s and Oceanic Islands provinces (>400 g/m2), associated with the influence of cold currents in the northernmost region and less fishing pressure in protected areas. A decreasing pattern of MFG richness towards the tropics was observed, which demonstrates that in the ETP, the relationship between habitat heterogeneity and species diversity has been translated into functional complexity. The Mexican province was the most functionally diverse (biomass well distributed in the MFG; H′ = 0.46 ± 0.009). Related to this, it is predicted that biomass is biased towards certain functional groups (i.e., large carnivores), which shows that the H′ index of the MFG is not a good indicator of the conservation status of ETP reefs. Finally, regression analysis suggests that functional diversity increases at low species diversity but eventually reaches an asymptote (almost all possible functions are represented).},

The SREX approaches the topic by assessing the scientific literature on issues that range from the relationship between climate change and extreme weather and climate events (‘climate extremes') to the implications of these events for society and sustainable development. The assessment concerns the interaction of climatic, environmental, and human factors that can lead to impacts and disasters, options for managing the risks posed by impacts and disasters, and the important role that non-climatic factors play in determining impacts. Box SPM.1 defines concepts central to the SREX. The character and severity of impacts from climate extremes depend not only on the extremes themselves but also on exposure and vulnerability. In this report, adverse impacts are considered disasters when they produce widespread damage and cause severe alterations in the normal functioning of communities or societies. Climate extremes, exposure, and vulnerability are influenced by a wide range of factors, including anthropogenic climate change, natural climate variability, and socioeconomic development (Figure SPM.1). Disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change focus on reducing exposure and vulnerability and increasing resilience to the potential adverse impacts of climate extremes, even though risks cannot fully be eliminated (Figure SPM.2). Although mitigation of climate change is not the focus of this report, adaptation and mitigation can complement each other and together can significantly reduce the risks of climate change},

abstract = {1 The level of functional redundancy in natural communities is likely to modulate how ecosystem stability is affected by local species extinction. Thus, extinction should have no effect if all species have similar functions, but a major effect if each carries different functions 2 We provide a probabilistic framework that, from any distribution of species number across functional groups, generates specific predictions of how functional groups are lost when species become randomly extinct within a given community. In particular, we predict how many species can go extinct before a community loses its first functional group, a useful index for conservation purposes. 3 We demonstrate that the probability of a whole functional group becoming extinct from a given community increases with the number of recognized functional groups (functional richness) but decreases with species richness and functional evenness (the distribution of species across functional groups). 4 Application of this framework to one published data set for a South American plant community suggested that, if local extinction is random, 75% of the species could be lost before the disappearance of the first functional group. 5 However, if redundancy is to be used to determine conservation priorities, the definition of functional groups must be carefully reviewed.},

abstract = {This review evaluates the generalisation that tenitorial, herbivorous damselfishes (Pomacentridae) have a major influence on the structure of algal, coral, other invertebrate and fish assemblages on coral reefs. Herbivorous damselfishes are a diverse, widespread and abund- ant component of reef fish assemblages and their tenitories take up a significant proportion of the shallow reef substratum. There are several mechanisms by which they potentially affect community structure within tenitories, including both food consumption and potential "farm- ing" activities, such as "weeding" of undesirable organisms, "killing" coral to grow algae, providing nutrients for algal "crops" and the aggressive "defence" of vital resources. A synthesis of the literature that documents assemblages both inside and outside tenitories revealed a number of common patterns. Erect filamentous algae often dominate tenitories, whereas low-lying crustose coralline and prostrate algae characterise adjacent areas. Further- more, territories consistently support a greater biomass, productivity and species richness of algae than undefended areas. Experimental studies suggest that damselfishes modify regimes of disturbance and succession but the potentially different effects of feeding, farming and tenitorial exclusion suggest a more complex interaction of processes. There are also substantial differences between defended and undefended areas in coral species composition and densities of small, mobile organisms such as cryptofauna and juvenile fishes, whereas larger herbivorous fishes are excluded from territories. However, the larger-scale effects of these interactions on the ecology of "included" or "excluded" species has yet to be examined. Many of the above generalisations may be premature as the literature is clearly biased towards a few larger, more aggressive species that maintain conspicuous algal mats. Our review draws attention to the numerically more abundant and less aggressive herbivorous species whose effects appear to be less dramatic. Furthermore, the spatial and temporal variability in the structure of damselfish communities is largely unknown, further restricting our ability to make valid generalisations. While the effects of tenitoriality have been tested by damselfish removals, more sophisticated experimental work is needed to assess the relative contributions of selective feeding, reduced herbivory, weeding and other farming activities. These mechanisms will be clearer if we have a better understanding of the function of telTitoriality, the actual benefits of algal turfs to the damselfishes and the separate tasks involved with establishing and maintaining territories.

abstract = {Coral reefs increasingly are undergoing transitions from coral to macroalgal dominance. Although the functional roles of reef herbivores in controlling algae are becoming better understood, identifying possible tipping points in the herbivory-macroalgae relationships has remained a challenge. Assessment of where any coral reef ecosystem lies in relation to the coral-to-macroalgae tipping point is fundamental to understanding resilience properties, forecasting state shifts, and developing effective management practices. We conducted a multi-year field experiment in Moorea, French Polynesia to estimate these properties. While we found a sharp herbivory threshold where macroalgae escape control, ambient levels of herbivory by reef fishes were well above that needed to prevent proliferation of macroalgae. These findings are consistent with previously observed high resilience of the fore reef in Moorea. Our approach can identify vulnerable coral reef systems in urgent need of management action to both forestall shifts to macroalgae and preserve properties essential for resilience.},

We consider the direct and indirect effects of subsistence exploitation upon the size structure of coral reef fish communities along an island-scale spatial gradient of fishing intensity. We explored the effect of fishing intensity and sample date (three dates over a year) at six islands and the overall effect of fishing intensity averaged over sample dates at 13 islands. Fishing intensity consistently explained more of the variation in the size metrics than sample date. In response to exploitation, the mean weight of individuals declined by 52%, the weighted average maximum size (Lmax) declined by 25%, and slopes of community size spectra steepened. The larger size classes (>26 cm) declined in relative numbers by 63% and relative biomass by 61% in response to exploitation. However, the numbers and biomass of the three smallest size classes (<25 cm) increased by 31% and 9%, respectively, in response to exploitation. This increased abundance is consistent with a weak compensatory response presumably from a reduction in predation upon smaller size classes as an indirect effect of exploiting larger size classes.},

abstract = {Herbivory is a significant driver of algal community dynamics on coral reefs. However, abiotic factors such as the complexity and orientation of the benthos often mediate the impact of herbivores on benthic communities. We experimentally evaluated the independent and interactive effects of substrate orientation and herbivorous fishes on algal community dynamics on a coral reef in the Florida Keys, USA. We created horizontal and vertical substrates, mimicking the trend in the reduction of vertical surfaces of coral reefs, to assess how algal communities developed either with herbivory (open areas) or without herbivory (herbivore exclosures). We found that substrate orientation was the dominant influence on macroalgal community composition. Herbivores had little impact on community development of vertical substrates as crustose algae dominated these substrates regardless of being in exclosures or open areas. In contrast, herbivores strongly impacted communities on horizontal substrates, with upright macroalgae (e.g., Dictyota spp., articulated coralline algae) dominating herbivore exclosures, while filamentous turf algae and sediment dominated open areas. Outside of exclosures, differences between vertical and horizontal substrates exposed to herbivores persisted despite similar intensity of herbivory. Our results suggest that the orientation of the reef benthos has an important impact on benthic communities. On vertical surfaces, abiotic factors may be more important for structuring algal communities while herbivory may be more important for controlling algal dynamics in flatter areas. Thus, the decline in structural complexity of Caribbean coral reefs and the flattening of reef substrates may fundamentally alter the impact that herbivores have on benthic community dynamics.},

abstract = {A major objective in ecology is to determine how local species abundances relate to their functional trait values (i.e. trait–abundance relationship), under a combined influence of 1) environmental filters affecting local species performance conditionally to trait values, 2) neutral demographic and immigration dynamics affecting abundances independently from these trait values, and 3) varying availability and frequency of species at regional level. We examined the nature and strength of the trait–abundance relationship in 30 000 simulated communities covering a gradient of the relative importance of niche-based environmental filtering and neutral stochastic processes, with heterogeneous regional species frequencies. We explored scenarios of directional, stabilizing and disruptive filtering differently affecting the success of species in communities, depending on their relative trait values. We evaluated how the four first moments of the trait distribution in a local community (i.e. abundance-weighted mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis) were influenced by immigration, environmental filtering and neutral dynamics. Then we determined whether including constraints related to these moments in a Bayesian maximum entropy regression improved the prediction of the trait–abundance relationships. First, we found pervasive influence of regional frequencies on local species abundances, related to regular input of immigrants. Second, the first four moments of the local trait distribution were affected by environmental filtering, the shape of the response depending on the type of filtering. Third, with decreasing immigration rate, the imprint of local demographic stochasticity overrode the impact of environmental filtering on trait–abundance relationships. Lastly, accounting for the mean and variance of local trait distribution appeared sufficient to explain the trait–abundance relationships in our regression framework, although their contribution differed depending on the type of environmental filtering. Therefore, the mean and variance of trait values in communities, two pillars of trait-gradient analyses in functional ecology, can capture the key influence of environmental filtering on local trait–abundance relationships.},

abstract = {The traditional likelihood-based test for differences in multivariate dispersions is known to be sensitive to nonnormality. It is also impossible to use when the number of variables exceeds the number of observations. Many biological and ecological data sets have many variables, are highly skewed, and are zero-inflated. The traditional test and even some more robust alternatives are also unreasonable in many contexts where measures of dispersion based on a non-Euclidean dissimilarity would be more appropriate. Distance-based tests of homogeneity of multivariate dispersions, which can be based on any dissimilarity measure of choice, are proposed here. They rely on the rotational invariance of either the multivariate centroid or the spatial median to obtain measures of spread using principal coordinate axes. The tests are straightforward multivariate extensions of Levene's test, with P-values obtained either using the traditional F-distribution or using permutation of either least-squares or LAD residuals. Examples illustrate the utility of the approach, including the analysis of stabilizing selection in sparrows, biodiversity of New Zealand fish assemblages, and the response of Indonesian reef corals to an El Ni{\~{n}}o. Monte Carlo simulations from the real data sets show that the distance-based tests are robust and powerful for relevant alternative hypotheses of real differences in spread. {\textcopyright} 2005, The International Biometric Society.},

Here, we propose a means for quantifying functional diversity that may be particularly useful for determining how functional diversity is related to ecosystem functioning. This measure of functional diversity "FD" is defined as the total branch length of a functional dendrogram. Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional groups in a community. Simulating species' trait values illustrates how the relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness.},

The development and characteristics of the GSV are presented herein. An approach is also proposed for delineating standardised, high spatial resolution global ecological coastal units (ECUs).

abstract = {The present two-part review aims to put the different phenomena that have been called "beta diversity" over the years into a common conceptual framework and to explain what each of them measures. The first part (Tuomisto 2010) discussed basic definitions of "beta diversity". Each arises from a different way of combining a definition of "diversity" with a definition of its alpha component and with a mathematical relationship between the alpha and gamma components. This second part assumes that an appropriate basic definition of a beta component (which may or may not be true beta diversity) has been chosen, and the focus here will be on how to quantify it for a given dataset. About twenty different approaches have been used for this purpose. It turns out that only two of these approaches accurately quantify the selected beta component: one does so for the entire dataset, and the other for two sampling units at a time. The other approaches actually quantify other phenomena, such as mean species turnover between sampling units, compositional gradient length (with or without reference to an external gradient), distinctness of a focal sampling unit, rate of species accumulation with increasing sampling effort, rate of compositional turnover along an external gradient, or the rate of decay in compositional similarity with increasing geographical distance. Although most of these phenomena can be expressed as a function of a beta component of diversity, they do not equal a beta component of diversity. Many of these derived variables are not even numerically correlated with the beta component on which they are based, which needs to be taken into account when interpreting the results. The effects of sampling decisions when results are extrapolated beyond the available data will also be discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author.

abstract = {Symbiosis with photoautotrophic organisms has evolved in various species and even whole animal lineages, which allowed them to directly benefit from photosynthesis. This so-called photosymbiosis is best studied in cnidarians, which primarily establish symbioses with dinoflagellates from the family Symbiodiniaceae. In most other animals the mechanisms of establishing photosymbiosis, the physiological basis, and the evolution of a photosymbiotic life history remain poorly understood. Sea slugs belonging to the Cladobranchia (Gastropoda, Nudibranchia) are no exception, and are a rather neglected animal lineage in the research field of photosymbiosis. Yet, studying these sea slugs holds great potential to establish a unique photosymbiosis model, as they are the only known taxon that has evolved two different strategies to acquire their symbiont: either from cnidarian prey (thus becoming a secondary host) or directly out of the water column. The mechanisms for photobiont uptake and maintenance are unknown for these sea slugs, but might be similar to those of cnidarians. However, in terms of the evolution of photosymbiosis, Cladobranchia seem to share many commonalities with more closely related sea slugs belonging to the Sacoglossa, which only maintain the chloroplasts of the algae they feed on. Hence, Cladobranchia have the potential to shed light on the evolution of photosymbiosis in taxonomically divergent animals that also harbor photobionts of different evolutionary lineages.},

Furthermore, we identify spatial and temporal patterns, outline factors influencing browsing, and discuss the probability of phase shift reversal. We formulate research recommendations addressing the identified gaps in knowledge about the interactions of browsing fishes and their environment. To date, 37 species of fishes have been observed consuming macroalgae in the Indo-Pacific. The most important groups are the family Siganidae, the subfamily Scarinae (Labridae), and the subfamily Nasinae (Acanthuridae). Browsing species vary between studies depending on location, season and macroalgae species examined. Several influencing factors, such as structural complexity, palatability of macroalgae and ecosystem connectivity have been suggested to cause these discrepancies. The most promising avenues for future research are the effect of structural complexity, the importance of mobile link species and influences of food availability on the selectivity of browsing species. Increasing our knowledge in these fields will provide a better basis for successful management strategies directed at increasing the resilience of coral reefs.},

Understanding the role of species with rare traits, i.e. functionally rare species, in community assembly, ecosystem dynamics and functioning has recently gained momentum. However, functional rarity is still ignored in conservation strategies. Here, we quantified global functional and evolutionary rarity for 2073 species of coral reef fishes and compared the rarity values to IUCN Red List status. Most species were functionally common but geographically rare. However, we found very weak correlation between functional rarity and evolutionary rarity. Functional rarity was highest for species classified as not evaluated or threatened by the IUCN Red List. The location of functional rarity hotspots (Tropical Eastern Pacific) did not match hotspots of species richness and evolutionary distinctiveness (Indo-Australian Archipelago), nor the currently protected areas. We argue that functional rarity should be acknowledged for both species and site prioritization in conservation strategies.},

abstract = {Prey traits linking consumer diversity to ecosystem function remain poorly understood. On tropical coral reefs, herbivores promote coral dominance by suppressing competing macroalgae, but the roles of herbivore identity and diversity, macroalgal defenses, and their interactions in affecting reef resilience and function are unclear. We studied adjacent pairs of no-take marine reserves and fished areas on reefs in Fiji and found that protected reefs supported 7-17× greater biomass, 2-3× higher species richness of herbivorous fishes, and 3- 11× more live coral cover than did fished reefs. In contrast, macroalgae were 27-61× more abundant and 3-4× more species-rich on fished reefs. When we transplanted seven common macroalgae from fished reefs into reserves they were rapidly consumed, suggesting that rates of herbivory (ecosystem functioning) differed inside vs. outside reserves. We then video-recorded feeding activity on the same seven macroalgae when transplanted into reserves, and assessed the functional redundancy vs. complementarity of herbivorous fishes consuming these macroalgae. Of 29 species of larger herbivorous fishes on these reefs, only four species accounted for 97% of macroalgal consumption. Two unicornfish consumed a range of brown macroalgae, a parrotfish consumed multiple red algae, and a rabbitfish consumed a green alga, with almost no diet overlap among these groups. The two most chemically rich, allelopathic algae were each consumed by a single, but different, fish species. This striking complementarity resulted from herbivore species differing in their tolerances to macroalgal chemical and structural defenses. A model of assemblage diet breadth based on our feeding observations predicted that high browser diversity would be required for effective control of macroalgae on Fijian reefs. In support of this model, we observed strong negative relationships between herbivore diversity and macroalgal abundance and diversity across the six study reefs. Our findings indicate that the total diet breadth of the herbivore community and the probability of all macroalgae being removed from reefs by herbivores increases with increasing herbivore diversity, but that a few critical species drive this relationship. Therefore, interactions between algal defenses and herbivore tolerances create an essential role for consumer diversity in the functioning and resilience of coral reefs. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Next we consider consumers, covering the major reef trophic guilds in the eastern Pacific---suspension feeders, deposit and detritus feeders, herbivores, carnivores (predators and carnivorous grazers), as well as scavengers. The diversity and relative abundance of consumer taxa are described and considered in terms of their ecological roles in community processes. The complex interplay of these guilds is examined through food webs constructed for Panama, Cabo Pulmo reef in the Gulf of California, Mexico, and the Floreana Island rocky reef in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos Islands. Finally, the effects of physical and biotic perturbations on food webs, interactions, indirect effects, and trophic cascades conclude this review.},

We synthesize current understanding of the relationships between ecological services and functional groups of Species and biological communities of coral reefs in different regions of the world. The consequences of human impacts on coral reefs are also discussed, including loss of resilience, or buffer capacity. Such loss may impair the capacity for recovery of coral reefs and as a consequence the quality and quantity of their delivery of ecological goods and services.

To explore the relationships between habitat structure, distribution, and diversity of conspicuous reef fish, surveys were made in 1994, 1995 and 1998 at Los Islotes, a rocky islet located north of Bahia de La Paz, B.C.S., Mexico. The site was divided into six zones, which presented different habitats: rhodoliths, walls, big boulders, small boulders and black coral. Some physical descriptors for the substrate were determined: depth, rugosity, number and size of rocks, and the percent coverage of several types of sessile invertebrates. Number of species and abundances were determined by visual transects. Two main seasons were distinguished, and the number of species was different between seasons and among zones. Four fish groups were identified based on the frequency and abundance of species. These fish groups presented similar proportions in each zone. Although most species recorded at Los Islotes were found in all the studied habitats, their densities varied significantly between habitats, suggesting groups of 'representative' species. Correlation analysis showed relationships between physical characteristics and the 'representative' species, that can be explained by the natural history of each species, including feeding behavior and shelter requirements},

To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.},

@article{Daw2016,
abstract = {Although ecosystem services are increasingly recognized as benefits people obtain from nature, we still have a poor understanding of how they actually enhance multidimensional human well-being, and how well-being is affected by ecosystem change. We develop a concept of “ecosystem service elasticity” (ES elasticity) that describes the sensitivity of human well-being to changes in ecosystems. ES Elasticity is a result of complex social and ecological dynamics and is context dependent, individually variable, and likely to demonstrate nonlinear dynamics such as thresholds and hysteresis. We present a conceptual framework that unpacks the chain of causality from ecosystem stocks through flows, goods, value, and shares to contribute to the well-being of different people. This framework builds on previous conceptualizations, but places multidimensional well-being of different people as the final element. This ultimately disaggregated approach emphasizes how different people access benefits and how benefits match their needs or aspirations. Applying this framework to case studies of individual coastal ecosystem services in East Africa illustrates a wide range of social and ecological factors that can affect ES elasticity. For example, food web and habitat dynamics affect the sensitivity of different fisheries ecosystem services to ecological change. Meanwhile high cultural significance, or lack of alternatives enhance ES elasticity, while social mechanisms that prevent access can reduce elasticity. Mapping out how chains are interlinked illustrates how different types of value and the well-being of different people are linked to each other and to common ecological stocks. We suggest that examining chains for individual ecosystem services can suggest potential interventions aimed at poverty alleviation and sustainable ecosystems while mapping out of interlinkages between chains can help to identify possible ecosystem service trade-offs and winners and losers. We discuss conceptual and practical challenges of applying such a framework and conclude on its utility as a heuristic for structuring interdisciplinary analysis of ecosystem services and human wellbeing.},

abstract = {Aim: Marine reef habitats are typically defined subjectively. We provide a continental-scale assessment of dominant reef habitats through analysis of macroalgae and sessile animal taxa at sites distributed around Australia. Relationships between reef habitats and environmental and anthropogenic factors are assessed, and potential changes in the future distribution and persistence of habitats are considered. Location: Shallow rocky and coral reefs around the Australian coast. Methods: Cover of 38 sessile biota functional groups was recorded in diver-based surveys using quadrats at 1,299 sites. Classification analyses based on the functional groups were used to identify an unambiguous set of ‘biogenic habitat types'. Random forest and distance-based linear modelling were used to investigate correlations between these habitats and environmental and anthropogenic variables. Results: Cluster analyses revealed tropical and temperate ‘realms' in benthic substratum composition, each with finer-scale habitats: four for the temperate realm (canopy algae, barren, epiphytic algae–understorey and turf) and five for the tropical realm (coral, coral–bacterial mat, turf–coral, calcified algae–coral and foliose algae). Habitats were correlated with different sets of environmental and anthropogenic conditions, with key associations in the temperate realm between mean sea temperature and canopy-forming algae (negative) and barren habitat (positive). Variation in sea temperature was also an important correlate in the tropical realm. Main conclusions: Quantitative delineation of inshore reef habitats at a continental scale identifies many of the same habitat types traditionally recognized through subjective methods. Importantly, many biogenic reef habitats were closely related to environmental parameters and anthropogenic variables that are predicted to change. Consequently, habitats have differing likelihood of persistence. Structurally complex habitats in the temperate realm are at greater risk than more ‘two-dimensional' habitats (e.g., canopy-forming versus turfing algae). In the tropical realm, offshore and coastal habitats differed greatly, highlighting the importance of large-scale oceanic conditions in shaping biogenic structure.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects <70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Sustainably managing natural resources under climate change requires understanding how species distribution shifts can impact ecosystem structure and functioning. While numerous studies have documented changes in species' distributions and abundances in response to warming [1, 2], the consequences for the functional structure of ecosystems (i.e., composition of species' functional traits) have received less attention. Here, using thirty years of fish monitoring, we show that two connected North Atlantic ecosystems (E. English Channel and S. North Sea) underwent a rapid shift in functional structure triggered by a climate oscillation to a prevailing warm-phase in the late-1990s. Using time-lag-based causality analyses, we found that rapid warming drove pelagic fishes with r-selected life history traits (e.g., low age and size at maturity, small offspring, low trophic level) to shift abruptly northward from one ecosystem to the other, causing an inversion in functional structure between the two connected ecosystems. While we observed only a one-year time-lag between the climate oscillation and the functional shift, indicating rapid responses to a changing environment, historical overfishing likely rendered these ecosystems susceptible to climatic stress [3], and declining fishing in the North Sea may have exacerbated the shift. This shift likely had major consequences for ecosystem functioning due to potential changes in biomass turnover, nutrient cycling, and benthic-pelagic coupling [4–6]. Under ongoing warming, climate oscillations and extreme warming events may increase in frequency and severity [7, 8], which could trigger functional shifts with profound consequences for ecosystem functioning and services. McLean et al. show that climate-induced changes in fishes' distributions and abundances between two connected ecosystems caused inverse shifts in functional structure, primarily driven by pelagic species with rapid life histories. Future climate change could trigger similar functional shifts with profound consequences for ecosystem functioning.},

Within a local community, competition leads to ecological differentiation of coexisting species, while habitat filtering reduces the spread of trait values, reflecting shared ecological tolerances. Many statistical tests for the effects of competition exist in the literature, but measures of habitat filtering are less well-developed. Here, we present convex hull volume, a construct from computational geometry, which provides an n-dimensional measure of the volume of trait space occupied by species in a community. Combined with ecological null models, this measure offers a useful test for habitat filtering. We use convex hull volume and a null model to analyze California woody-plant trait and community data. Our results show that observed plant communities occupy less trait space than expected from random assembly, a result consistent with habitat filtering. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Meta-analysis is a statistical procedure for analyzing the combined data from different studies, and can be a major source of concise up-to-date information. The overall conclusions of a meta-analysis, however, depend heavily on the quality of the meta-analytic process, and an appropriate evaluation of the quality of meta-analysis (meta-evaluation) can be challenging. We outline ten questions biologists can ask to critically appraise a meta-analysis. These questions could also act as simple and accessible guidelines for the authors of meta-analyses. We focus on meta-analyses using non-human species, which we term 'biological' meta-analysis. Our ten questions are aimed at enabling a biologist to evaluate whether a biological meta-analysis embodies 'mega-enlightenment', a 'mega-mistake', or something in between.},

abstract = {For a fish, the north coast of Jamaica is a lonely place. Fishing intensities are so high that most fish are caught long before they reach maturity. Coral reefs there are festooned with traps, hooks, and nets, while spearfishers hunt all day to depths of more than fifteen meters. Diving these reefs, one is struck by the absence of fish bigger than 15 cm and by the abundance of tiny fish, mostly species of little commercial interest. What is truly amazing about Jamaica is that there are any fish at all! With few local sources of the larger, commercially important fish remaining, Jamaican fisheries are partly supplied by fish arriving from other parts of the Caribbean where breeding stocks are in better shapeperhaps as far afield as the Turks and Caicos and Bahamas (1) (M. Watson, pers. comm.). Jamaicas over-hunted reefs are a sink to these sources. In the past, intensive nearshore fisheries often were supplied by populations reproducing in natural refugesplaces that were too deep, too remote, too dangerous, or too rough to fish. The behemoth lobsters that once commanded the deep sea floor off Cape Cod are an example. But as the reach of fishing expands, much of the seas are going the way of Jamaica and there are fewer sources to rely on. Without refuges, the future for fishing is bleak. There is a solution to this problem. We can create source populations to supply fisheries by establishing new refugesplaces that are fully protected from all fishing. While the land and sea are different in many ways, reserves are remarkably similarprotect an area from fishing or hunting and you get more and bigger animals in a short time. Recently, such marine reserves have been in the conservation spotlight. The findings of a new research synthesis were released at the 2001 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Also the National Academy of Science in the USA has just published a report on marine protected areas (2). Both groups argue that the use of fully protected reserves should be greatly expanded. Moreover, they envision reserves established throughout the oceans in networks linked by the invisible threads of larval transport. Our present approach to creating reserves falls far short of this vision. Currently, only a few fully protected reserves exist, mostly small 10 km2) and highly isolated (often hundreds of kilometers apart). Together they cover less than one ten-thousandth of the sea (3). As such, the challenge we face is how to design marine reserve networks that will interact effectively and meet our goals of sustained and productive marine communities. Here we describe what such networks might look like and how to go about building them.},

Here, we report that spatial scale and type of biodiversity measurement influence evidence of temporal biodiversity change. We show a pervasive scale dependence of temporal trends in taxonomic (TD) and functional (FD) diversity for an $\sim$50-year record of avian assemblages from North American Breeding Bird Survey and a record of global extinctions. Average TD and FD increased at all but the global scale. Change in TD exceeded change in FD toward large scales, signaling functional resilience. Assemblage temporal dissimilarity and turnover (replacement of species or functions) declined, while nestedness (tendency of assemblages to be subsets of one another) increased with scale. Patterns of FD change varied strongly among diet and foraging guilds. We suggest that monitoring, policy, and conservation require a scale-explicit framework to account for the pervasive effect that scale has on perceived biodiversity change.},

abstract = {Electrophoresis was used to provide genetic evidence of the mode of production of brooded planulae in each of four species of scleractinian coral collected from the central region of the Great Barrier Reef during September, October and November 1984. Comparisons were made of the multi-locus genotypes of planulae and their broodparents for two ahermatypic (non zooxanthellate) species, Tubastraea diaphana and T. coccinea and two hermatypic (zooxanthellate) species, Acropora palifera and Seriatopora hystrix. For both ahermatypic species, all planulae were found to be genetically identical to their broodparents, including 91 planulae which were heterozygous for at least one locus. These results are consistent with asexual (ameiotic) reproduction. In contrast, non-parental genotypes were detected in the majority of hermatypic broods, which is consistent with expectations for sexual reproduction with at least some outcrossing. These data confirmed that brooded planulae may be produced both sexually and asexually and countered the suggestion that electrophoretic studies of hermatypic corals may be weakened by the contaminating effect of the enzymes of their symbiotic xooxanthellae. {\textcopyright} 1986 Springer-Verlag.},

This study aimed to estimate spatiotemporal variation of sexual recruitment along two areas of the southwestern coast of the Gulf of California (Bah{\'{i}}a de La Paz and Bah{\'{i}}a de Loreto) considered to be suboptimal for coral development (strong seasonality and variability of sea-surface temperature, incidence of hurricanes, turbidity and nutrient concentration, and low $\Omega$ar). Recruitment data were compared to sea-surface temperatures and with recruitment data from other sites in the eastern Pacific that have less-stressful environments. Terracotta tiles were used as collectors of larval coral propagules; tiles were immersed for 3-month periods between August 2004 and September 2005. Higher recruitment was found during the warm season, and coral recruits were found at almost all sites, including a vessel grounding area. Recruitment was higher in Bah{\'{i}}a de La Paz [12.80 ± 29.57 individuals (ind) m-2 yr-1] than in Bah{\'{i}}a de Loreto (0.99 ± 1.49 ind m-2 yr-1).

Here, we estimate the total number of reef-building corals and the population sizes of more than 300 individual species on reefs spanning the Pacific Ocean biodiversity gradient, from Indonesia to French Polynesia. Our analysis suggests that approximately half a trillion corals (0.3 × 1012–0.8 × 1012) inhabit these coral reefs, similar to the number of trees in the Amazon. Two-thirds of the examined species have population sizes exceeding 100 million colonies, and one-fifth of the species even have population sizes greater than 1 billion colonies. Our findings suggest that, while local depletions pose imminent threats that can have ecologically devastating impacts to coral reefs, the global extinction risk of most coral species is lower than previously estimated.},

abstract = {The establishment of no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) on coral reefs is a common management strategy for conserving the diversity, abundance, and biomass of reef organisms. Generally, well-managed and enforced MPAs can increase or maintain the diversity and function of the enclosed coral reef, with some of the benefits extending to adjacent nonprotected reefs. A fundamental question in coral reef conservation is whether these benefits arise within small MPAs (<1 km2 ), because larval input of reef organisms is largely decoupled from local adult reproduction. We examined the structure of fish assemblages, composition of fish feeding groups, benthic cover, and key ecosystem processes (grazing, macroalgal browsing, and coral replenishment) in three small (0.5-0.8 km2 ) no-take MPAs and adjacent areas where fisheries are allowed (non-MPAs) on coral reefs in Fiji. The MPAs exhibited greater species richness, density, and biomass of fishes than non-MPAs. Furthermore, MPAs contained a greater abundance and biomass of grazing herbivores and piscivores as well as a greater abundance of cleaners than fished areas. We also found differences in fish associations when foraging, with feeding groups being generally more diverse and having greater biomass within MPAs than adjacent non-MPAs. Grazing by parrotfishes was 3-6 times greater, and macroalgal browsing was 3-5 times greater in MPAs than in non-MPAs. On average, MPAs had 260-280% as much coral cover and only 5-25% as much macroalgal cover as their paired non-MPA sites. Finally, two of the three MPAs had three-fold more coral recruits than adjacent non-MPAs. The results of this study indicate that small MPAs benefit not only populations of reef fishes, but also enhance ecosystem processes that are critical to reef resilience within the MPAs.},

abstract = {Latitudinal declines of species richness from the tropics to the poles represent a general spatial pattern of diversity on land. For the marine realm, the generality of this pattern has frequently been questioned. Here, I use a database with nearly 600 published gradients (198 of which were marine) to assess whether there is a marine latitudinal diversity gradient of similar average strength and slope as that for terrestrial organisms. Using meta-analysis techniques, I also tested which characteristics of organisms or habitats affected gradient strength and slope. The overall strength and slope of the gradient for marine organisms was significantly negative and of similar magnitude compared to gradients for terrestrial organisms. Marine gradients were on average stronger as well as steeper than freshwater gradients. Latitudinal gradients were clearly a regional phenomenon, with stronger gradients and steeper slopes for diversity assessed on regional than on local scales. The gradient parameters differed also between oceans and between different habitats, with steeper gradients related to the pelagial rather than the benthos. There were on the other hand no significant differences between hemispheres and between different gradient ranges, although such differences have often been presumed. The most important organismal characteristic related to gradient structure was body mass, with significant gradients related to large organisms. A significant increase in gradient strength with increasing trophic level was observed. The meta-analysis also revealed strongest gradients for nekton and mobile epifauna, whereas the gradients were weak for sessile epifauna and for infauna. In conclusion, marine biota reveal a similar overall decline in diversity with latitude to that observed in terrestrial realms, but the strength and slope of the gradient are clearly subject to regional, habitat and organismal features.},

abstract = {We are in the Anthropocene—an epoch where humans are the dominant force of planetary change. Ecosystems increasingly reflect rapid human-induced, socioeconomic and cultural selection rather than being a product of their surrounding natural biophysical setting. This poses the intriguing question: To what extent do existing ecological paradigms capture and explain the current ecological patterns and processes we observe? We argue that, although biophysical drivers still influence ecosystem structure and function at particular scales, their ability to offer predictive capacity over coupled social–ecological systems is increasingly compromised as we move further into the Anthropocene. Traditionally, the dynamics of coral reefs have been studied in response to their proximate drivers of change rather than their underlying socioeconomic and cultural drivers. We hypothesise this is limiting our ability to accurately predict spatial and temporal changes in coral reef ecosystem structure and function. We propose “social–ecological macroecology” as a novel approach within the field of coral reef ecology to a) identify the interactive effects of biophysical and socioeconomic and cultural drivers of coral reef ecosystems across spatial and temporal scales; b) test the robustness of existing coral reef paradigms; c) explore whether existing paradigms can be adapted to capture the dynamics of contemporary coral reefs; and d) if they cannot, develop novel coral reef social–ecological paradigms, where human dynamics are part of the paradigms rather than the drivers of them. Human socioeconomic and cultural processes must become embedded in coral reef ecological theory and practice as much as biophysical processes are today if we are to predict and manage these systems successfully in this era of rapid change. This necessary shift in our approach to coral reef ecology will be challenging and will require truly interdisciplinary collaborations between the natural and social sciences.

abstract = {Sponges are an important component of coral reef communities. The present study is the first devoted exclusively to coral reef sponges from Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP). Eighty-seven species were found, with assemblages dominated by very small cryptic patches and boring sponges such as Cliona vermifera; the most common species in ETP reefs. We compared the sponge patterns from ETP reefs, Caribbean reefs (CR) and West Pacific reefs (WPR), and all have in common that very few species dominate the sponge assemblages. However, they are massive or large sun exposed sponges in CR and WPR, and small encrusting and boring cryptic species in ETP. At a similar depth, CR and WPR had seven times more individuals per m2, and between four (CR) and five times (WPR) more species per m2 than ETP. Perturbation, at local and large scale, rather than biological factors, seems to explain the low prevalence and characteristics of sponge assemblages in ETP reefs, which are very frequently located in shallow water where excessive turbulence, abrasion and high levels of damaging light occur. Other factors such as the recurrence of large-scale phenomena (mainly El Ni{\~{n}}o events), age of the reef (younger in ETP), isolation (higher in ETP), difficulty to gain recruits from distant areas (higher in ETP), are responsible for shaping ETP sponge communities. Such great differences in sponge fauna between the three basins might have consequences for coral reef structure and dynamics.},

abstract = {Coral community composition varies considerably due to both environmental conditions and disturbance histories. However, the extent to which coral composition influences associated fish assemblages remains largely unknown. Here an ecological trait-based ordination analysis was used to compare functional richness (range of unique trait combinations), functional evenness (weighted distribution of fishes with shared traits), and functional divergence (proportion of total abundance supported by species with traits on the periphery of functional space) of fish assemblages among six distinct coral habitats. Despite no significant variation in species richness among habitats, there were differences in the functional richness and functional divergence, but not functional evenness, of fish assemblages among habitats. Structural complexity of coral assemblages was the best predictor of the differences in functional richness and divergence among habitats. Functional richness of fish assemblages was highest in branching Porites habitats, lowest in Pocillopora and soft coral habitats, and intermediate in massive Porites, staghorn Acropora, and mixed coral habitats. Massive and branching Porites habitats displayed greater functional divergence in fish assemblages than the Pocillopora habitat, whilst the remaining habitats were intermediate. Differences in functional richness and divergence were largely driven by the presence of small schooling planktivores in the massive and branching Porites habitats. These results indicate that differential structural complexity among coral communities may act as an environmental filter, affecting the distribution and abundance of associated species traits, particularly those of small-bodied schooling fishes.},

abstract = {Indices are used to quantify change in the environment by reducing aspects of environmental complexity to numbers. Biodiversity indices are typically calculated using the numbers of species and their relative abundances. A recent advance has been the development of additional measures of diversity, such as phylogenetic diversity, based on relationships between organisms. The emerging paradigms of the importance of biodiversity to ecosystem services and the ecosystem approach to fishery management could be well served by the development of indicators of ecosystem functioning. We discuss how relatedness measures may be adapted to quantify aspects of community structure of relevance to ecosystem functioning, by combining information on species' occurrence, life history, and ecological traits. We present an index that reflects average functional distinctness within assemblages. We illustrate the approach using North Sea fish. Results reveal that average functional distinctness is not independent of taxonomic distinctness. This is expected, but the weakness of the relationship suggests that both indices may prove useful, because they are not constrained to convey the same information about samples. Both indices are shown to be weakly related to species richness, which was not expected. This is a consequence of differences in the frequencies of occurrence among species. {\textcopyright} 2008 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Published by Oxford Journals.

Separating causality from simple correlation requires distinguishing among experimental treatments, experimental responses, and the many processes and properties that are correlated with either the treatments or the responses, or both. When an experimental manipulation has multiple components, but only one of them is identified as the experimental treatment, erroneous conclusions about cause and effect relationships are likely because the actual cause of any observed response may be ignored in the interpretation of the experimental results. This unrecognized cause of an observed response can be considered a 'hidden treatment.' Three types of hidden treatments are potential problems in biodiversity experiments: (1) abiotic conditions, such as resource levels, or biotic conditions, such as predation, which are intentionally or unintentionally altered in order to create differences in species numbers for 'diversity' treatments; (2) non-random selection of species with particular attributes that produce treatment differences that exceed those due to 'diversity' alone; and (3) the increased statistical probability of including a species with a dominant negative or positive effect (e.g., dense shade, or nitrogen fixation) in randomly selected groups of species of increasing number or 'diversity.' In each of these cases, treatment responses that are actually the result of the 'hidden treatment' may be inadvertently attributed to variation in species diversity. Case studies re-evaluating three different types of biodiversity experiments demonstrate that the increases found in such ecosystem properties as productivity, nutrient use efficiency, and stability (all of which were attributed to higher levels of species diversity) were actually caused by 'hidden treatments' that altered plant biomass and productivity.},

abstract = {Degradation of inshore coral reefs due to poor water quality is a major issue, yet it has proved difficult to demonstrate this linkage at other than local scales. This study modeled the relationships between large-scale data on water clarity and chlorophyll and four measures of reef status along the whole Great Barrier Reef, Australia (GBR; 12-24? S). Four biotic groups with different trophic requirements, namely, the cover of macroalgae and the taxonomic richness of hard corals and phototrophic and heterotrophic octocorals, were predicted from water quality and spatial location. Water clarity and chlorophyll showed strong spatial patterns, with water clarity increasing more than threefold from inshore to offshore waters and chlorophyll decreasing approximately twofold from inshore to offshore and approximately twofold from south to north. Richness of hard corals and phototrophic octocorals declined with increasing turbidity and chlorophyll, whereas macroalgae and the richness of heterotrophic octocorals increased. Macroalgal cover experienced the largest water quality effects, increasing fivefold with decreasing water clarity and 1.4-fold with increasing chlorophyll. For each of the four biota, ?45% of variation was predictable, with water quality effects accounting for 18-46% of that variation and spatial effects accounting for the remainder. Effects were consistent with the trophic requirements of the biota, suggesting that both macroalgal cover and coral biodiversity are partially controlled by energy supply limitation. Throughout the GBR, mean annual values of > 10 m Secchi disk depth (a measure of water clarity) and <0.45 g/L chlorophyll were associated with low macroalgal cover and high coral richness, indicating these values to be potentially useful water quality guidelines. The models predict that on the 22.8% of GBR reefs where guideline values are currently exceeded, water quality improvement, e.g., by minimizing agricultural runoff, should reduce macroalgal cover on average by 39% and increase the richness of hard corals and phototrophic octocorals on average by 16% and 33%, respectively (all else being equal). Such guidelines may help focus efforts to implement effective pollution reduction and integrated coastal management},

abstract = {Functional diversity indices are increasingly being used to describe plant community assembly processes and ecosystem functioning. However, their relevance for predicting alterations in ecosystem functioning of riparian plant communities is still largely unknown. We investigated the functional patterns of riparian forests along environmental gradients, using biological and environmental data from 189 well-preserved riverine locations in mainland Portugal. We calculated functional diversity indices (e.g. Richness, Redundancy, Divergence) for four riparian forest types, namely the Alder woodlands, Ash woodlands, Tree-heath shrublands and Mediterranean shrublands, using their plant species composition and 25 plant functional traits. We used multiple linear regression to predict the effect of the environment in the functional structure of riparian forests and ultimately evaluate the resilience of the riparian forests to environmental fluctuations. We found that Mediterranean shrublands have a significantly higher Functional Richness and a lower Functional Redundancy in comparison to the other riparian forest types. Both regional and habitat variables were important for predicting the functional diversity of riparian forests, with varying patterns according to forest types. In particular, we found that the redundancy of Mediterranean shrublands is mostly affected by precipitation, suggesting their potential vulnerability to climate change in the study area. Our results suggest the usefulness of functional diversity measures for conservation and monitoring the ecological functioning of riparian forests.},

The seawater CO2 system was highly variable in time and space, but was explained by physical forcing from meteorological (seasonal rainfall) and oceanographic (upwelling, tides) processes interacting with diurnal reef metabolism. Gal{\'{a}}pagos coral reef communities are naturally exposed to the highest ambient partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2) and lowest aragonite saturation ($\omega$arag) values documented for any coral reef environment to date. During upwelling in the Gal{\'{a}}pagos, mean pCO2 and mean $\omega$arag at five different sites ranged from 53.1 to 73.5 Pa and 2.27 to 2.86, respectively. Values of pCO2 and $\omega$arag ranged from 21.0 to 48.7 Pa and 2.47 to 4.18, respectively, on the Saboga Reef in the seasonally upwelling Gulf of Panam{\'{a}}, with the highest pCO2 and lowest $\omega$arag values occurring during upwelling. The Uva Reef, in the nonupwelling Gulf of Chiriqui of Pacific Panam{\'{a}}, had mean $\omega$arag values that were always significantly greater than those at the Saboga Reef. Diurnal changes in the seawater CO2 system from reef metabolism on the Uva Reef were magnified at low tide and highly significant differences were measured over depths as shallow as 1.5 m because of the shallow thermocline that is pervasive throughout the eastern Pacific. These naturally high-CO2 reefs persist near the $\omega$arag distributional threshold for coral reefs and are thus expected to be the first and most affected by ocean acidification. {\textcopyright} 2010, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Selection pressures along climate gradients give rise to predictable variation in plant functional traits of individual species suggestive of local adaptation. Species whose ranges include winter rainfall, Mediterranean climates, or other strongly seasonal climates, may be exposed to divergent selection pressures at different ends of seasonality gradients. Here, we evaluate how rainfall seasonality in conjunction with other key climatic variables impacts patterns of trait variation in Pelargonium scabrum, a woody shrub from the Greater Cape Floristic Region of South Africa. This biodiversity hotspot encompasses a Mediterranean climate (wet winters and hot, dry summers) and displays steep gradients in temperature and water availability. We used Bayesian regression models to evaluate leaf trait–trait and trait–climate relationships among 26 populations. Models included rainfall seasonality and its interaction with other climate variables (mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) as predictors to test for the impact of climate variation on three leaf traits: size, dissection and leaf mass per area (LMA). We evaluated model explanatory power by calculating Bayesian R2 values, and predictive power via leave-one-out cross-validation. Trait–trait associations were modulated by rainfall seasonality, including a reversal in the relationship between leaf size and dissection depending on the proportion of rain received in winter. Trait–climate models were improved by including rainfall seasonality as a predictor for both explanatory and predictive power. For leaf dissection and LMA, we detected significant interactions between rainfall seasonality and other environmental variables, leading to reversals in the relationships between these traits and the three environmental variables depending on the proportion of winter rainfall. Differences in the timing of rainfall, coupled with strong differences in the covariation of climate variables, impose divergent selection pressures on P. scabrum populations resulting in divergence of trait values, trait integration and responses to climate gradients. These patterns are consistent with local adaptation of P. scabrum populations mediated by the interactions between temperature and the amount and timing of rainfall. Species arrayed along broad climate gradients represent an excellent opportunity for investigating patterns of trait variation and abundances and distributions of species in relation to future changes in climate.

By defending feeding territories, damselfishes enhance the growth of turf algae in so-called algal farms and affect coral communities both directly and indirectly. We found several white scars (i.e., bite lesions) on massive Porites colonies around feeding territories. In this study, we examined the occurrence of white scars on corals and their function in coral–algal competition at the boundaries between algal farms of two damselfish species—the intensive farmer Stegastes nigricans, and the intermediate farmer S. lividus—and adjacent Porites corals for 3 years around Okinawa Island, Japan. White scars occurred on Porites colonies only adjacent to the territories of both damselfish species. Of the white scars on corals around S. nigricans territories, 73% of the area was covered by algae within 2 weeks, while the remaining was re-covered by Porites tissues. The coral–algal boundaries encroached further into areas of coral when the area of white scars were larger. These results suggest that both intensive and intermediate farmers bite adjacent Porites colonies causing white scars on corals, and expand their territories onto corals using algae-covered white scars as stepping stones.},

abstract = {The goal of conservation and restoration activities is to maintain biological diversity and the ecosystem services that this diversity provides. These activities traditionally focus on the measures of species diversity that include only information on the presence and abundance of species. Yet how diversity influences ecosystem function depends on the traits and niches filled by species. 2.Biological diversity can be quantified in ways that account for functional and phenotypic differences. A number of such measures of functional diversity (FD) have been created, quantifying the distribution of traits in a community or the relative magnitude of species similarities and differences. We review FD measures and why they are intuitively useful for understanding ecological patterns and are important for management. 3.In order for FD to be meaningful and worth measuring, it must be correlated with ecosystem function, and it should provide information above and beyond what species richness or diversity can explain. We review these two propositions, examining whether the strength of the correlation between FD and species richness varies across differing environmental gradients and whether FD offers greater explanatory power of ecosystem function than species richness. 4.Previous research shows that the relationship between FD and richness is complex and context dependent. Different functional traits can show individual responses to different gradients, meaning that important changes in diversity can occur with minimal change in richness. Further, FD can explain variation in ecosystem function even when richness does not. 5.Synthesis and applications. FD measures those aspects of diversity that potentially affect community assembly and function. Given this explanatory power, FD should be incorporated into conservation and restoration decision-making, especially for those efforts attempting to reconstruct or preserve healthy, functioning ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Due to climate change, coral reefs have experienced mass bleaching, and mortality events in recent years. Although coral reefs are unlikely to persist in their current form unless climate change can be addressed, local management can have a role to play by extending the time frame over which there are functional reef systems capable of recovery. Here we consider the potential application of one form of local management – management of herbivorous fishes. The premise behind this approach is that increased herbivory could shift reef algal assemblages to states that are benign or beneficial for corals, thereby increasing corals' ability to recover from destructive events such as bleaching and to thrive in periods between events. With a focus on Indo-Pacific coral reefs, we review what is known about the underlying processes of herbivory and coral-algal competition that ultimately affect the ability of corals to grow, persist, and replenish themselves. We then critically assess evidence of effectiveness or otherwise of herbivore management within marine protected areas (MPAs) to better understand why many MPAs have not improved outcomes for corals, and more importantly to identify the circumstances in which that form of management would be most likely to be effective. Herbivore management is not a panacea, but has the potential to enhance coral reef persistence in the right circumstances. Those include that: (i) absent management, there is an “algal problem” – i.e., insufficient herbivory to maintain algae in states that are benign or beneficial for corals; and (ii) management actions are able to increase net herbivory. As increased corallivory is a potentially widespread negative consequence of management, we consider some of the circumstances in which that is most likely to be a problem as well as potential solutions. Because the negative effects of certain algae are greatest for coral settlement and early survivorship, it may be that maintaining sufficient herbivory is particularly important in promoting recovery from destructive events such as mass bleaching. Thus, herbivore management can have a role to play as part of a wider strategy to manage and reduce the threats that currently imperil coral reefs.},

abstract = {Islands are pieces of land entirely surrounded by sea on which terrestrial and marine organisms live as little as a few metres apart. Yet, in contrast to terrestrial species, marine species have attracted little attention in studies of island theory. The experimental and conceptual origins of this dichotomy date back to the 1970s, although the apposition has softened in the early 2000s, in part a consequence of phylogeographic analyses and the discovery of new marine environments. Here, I explore the possible range of island and island-like settings in the marine realm and find good evidence, albeit in short supply, for integrating marine with terrestrial perspectives during the current transition from equilibrium to general dynamic models of island biogeography. This integration of marine systems into island theory will be facilitated by three advances: (1) development of many descriptive marine studies to reduce the current deficit, (2) design of rigorous comparative studies within and across realms, and (3) modification of conceptual models to unite seemingly disparate situations, for example describing islands in terms of ecological–evolutionary processes. Marine island biogeography is in its infancy; it may present situations that are uncommon in the existing literature, but not rare in nature, and thus contribute substantially to the new dynamic outlook on a half-century-old theme.},

In spite of its importance, ecologists have not always appreciated the effects of abundance and sampling effort on richness measures and comparisons. We survey a series of common pitfalls in quantifying and comparing taxon richness. These pitfalls can be largely avoided by using accumulation and rarefaction curves, which may be based on either individuals or samples. These taxon sampling curves contain the basic information for valid richness comparisons, including category-subcategory ratios (species-to-genus and species-to-individual ratios). Rarefaction methods - both sample-based and individual-based -allow for meaningful standardization and comparison of datasets. Standardizing data sets by area or sampling effort may produce very different results compared to standardizing by number of individuals collected, and it is not always clear which measure of diversity is more appropriate. Asymptotic richness estimators provide lower-bound estimates for taxon-rich groups such as tropical arthropods, in which observed richness rarely reaches an asymptote, despite intensive sampling. Recent examples of diversity studies of tropical trees, stream invertebrates, and herbaceous plants emphasize the importance of carefully quantifying species richness using taxon sampling curves.},

abstract = {Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about species' abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non-significant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Coral reefs provide ecosystem goods and services for millions of people in the tropics, but reef conditions are declining worldwide. Effective solutions to the crisis facing coral reefs depend in part on understanding the context under which different types of conservation benefits can be maximized. Our global analysis of nearly 1,800 tropical reefs reveals how the intensity of human impacts in the surrounding seascape, measured as a function of human population size and accessibility to reefs (“gravity”), diminishes the effectiveness of marine reserves at sustaining reef fish biomass and the presence of top predators, even where compliance with reserve rules is high. Critically, fish biomass in high-compliance marine reserves located where human impacts were intensive tended to be less than a quarter that of reserves where human impacts were low. Similarly, the probability of encountering top predators on reefs with high human impacts was close to zero, even in high-compliance marine reserves. However, we find that the relative difference between openly fished sites and reserves (what we refer to as conservation gains) are highest for fish biomass (excluding predators) where human impacts are moderate and for top predators where human impacts are low. Our results illustrate critical ecological trade-offs in meeting key conservation objectives: reserves placed where there are moderate-to-high human impacts can provide substantial conservation gains for fish biomass, yet they are unlikely to support key ecosystem functions like higher-order predation, which is more prevalent in reserve locations with low human impacts.},

abstract = {The inherent complexity of high-diversity systems can make them particularly difficult to understand. The relatively recent introduction of functional approaches, which seek to infer ecosystem functioning based on species' ecological traits, has revolutionized our understanding of these high-diversity systems. Today, the functional structure of an assemblage is widely regarded as a key indicator of the status or resilience of an ecosystem. Indeed, functional evaluations have become a mainstay of monitoring and management approaches. But is the heavy focus on broad metrics of functional structure grounded in empirical research? On tropical coral reefs, the ocean's most diverse ecosystems, remarkably few studies directly quantify ecosystem functions and the term ‘function' is widely used but rarely defined, especially when applied to reef fishes. Our review suggests that most ‘functional' studies do not study function as it relates to ecological processes. Rather, they look at easy-to-measure traits or proxies that are thought to have functional significance. However, these links are rarely tested empirically, severely limiting our capacity to extend results from community structure to the dynamic processes operating within high-diversity ecosystems such as coral reefs. With rapid changes in global ecosystems, and in their capacity to deliver ecosystem services, there is an urgent need to understand and empirically measure the role of organisms in various ecosystem functions. We suggest that if we are to understand and manage transitioning coral reefs in the Anthropocene, a broad definition of the word ‘function' is needed along with a focus on ecological processes and the empirical quantification of functional roles. In this review, we propose a universal operational definition of the term ‘function' that works from a cellular to a global level. Specifically, it is the movement or storage of energy or material. Within this broad definitional framework, all functions are part of a continuum that is tied together by the process-based unifier of material fluxes. With this universal definition at hand, we then present a path forward that will allow us to fully harness the power of functional approaches in understanding and managing high-diversity systems such as coral reefs.

Assessing whether MPA networks meet their objectives requires data from Before the establishment of the network to better discern natural spatiotemporal variation and preexisting differences from the response to protection. Here, we use a Progressive-Change BACIPS approach to assess the ecological effects of a network of five fully and three moderately protected MPAs on fish communities in two coral reef habitats (lagoon and fore reef) based on a time series of data collected five times (over three years) Before and 12 times (over nine years) After the network's establishment on the island of Moorea, French Polynesia. At the network scale, on the fore reef, density and biomass of harvested fishes increased by 19.3% and 24.8%, respectively, in protected areas relative to control fished areas. Fully protected areas provided greater ecological benefits than moderately protected areas. In the lagoon, density and biomass of harvested fishes increased, but only the 31% increase in biomass in fully protected MPAs was significant. Non-harvested fishes did not respond to protection in any of the habitats. We propose that these responses to protection were small, relative to other MPA assessments, due to limited compliance and weak surveillance, although other factors such as the occurrence of a crown-of-thorns starfish outbreak and a cyclone after the network was established may also have impeded the ability of the network to provide benefits. Our results highlight the importance of using fully protected MPAs over moderately protected MPAs to achieve conservation objectives, even in complex social–ecological settings, but also stress the need to monitor effects and adapt management based on ongoing assessments.},

abstract = {The macrobenthic (coral, algae, and sea urchins) and fish communities in 15 back-reef sites on the patch and rock-island reefs of southern Kenya and northern Tanzania ($\sim$250 km of coastline) were studied in order to (1) test an overfishing model developed in Kenya's fringing reef (McClanahan, 1995a, A coral reef ecosystem-fisheries model: impacts of fishing intensity and catch selection on reef structure and processes. Ecol. Model. 80, 1-19.), (2) develop a baseline of information on Tanzanian coral reef ecosystems, and (3) determine if some of the government gazetted but unprotected marine reserves were still deserving of protective management. The overfishing model was tested by comparing five sites in two fully protected reefs - one in southern Kenya (Kisite Marine National Park) and the other in Zanzibar (Chumbe Island Coral Park) - with 10 sites in eight fished reefs, and by comparing coral surveys conducted in reefs off of Dar es Salaam in 1974 with present-day studies. These comparisons suggest that fishing is primarily reducing the abundance of angelfish, butterflyfish, parrotfish, scavengers, surgeonfish, and triggerfish groups while some species of small-bodied damselfish and wrasse appear to have benefited. The total fish wet weight estimate was 3.5 times higher in protected than unprotected sites. Sea urchin abundance was six times higher, and predation rates on tethered sea urchin Echinometra mathaei were two times lower, in unprotected compared to protected sites. This is largely attributable to the reduction of the red-lined triggerfish Balistapus undulatus and other sea urchin predators by fishing. Loss of coral cover and changes in coral generic composition had occurred in four of the five sites visited in the Dar es Salaam area after the 22-year period. There was no evidence for species losses. One site appeared to be severely damaged over this time. Some reefs were dominated by fleshy brown algae, such as Sargassum and Dictyota, which may result from a loss of grazers and coral cover. Reduced fishing effort, elimination of destructive gear (dynamite and beach seines), protection of vulnerable species and, in some cases, sea urchin reductions could rectify the problems of overfishing. Despite the damage, the gazetted but unprotected reefs of Mbudya and Bongoyo still have high potential as marine protected areas due to the persistence of species and reef structure.},

This revolution of information is the result of heavy investment in new technology by governments and industry, rapid developments in computing power and storage, and easy dissemination of data over the internet. Today, remotely sensed data are available to virtually anyone with a desktop computer. Here, we review the status of one of the most popular areas of marine remote sensing research: coral reefs. Previous reviews have focused on the ability of remote sensing to map the structure and habitat composition of coral reefs, but have neglected to consider the physical environment in which reefs occur. We provide a holistic review of what can, might, and cannot be mapped using remote sensing at this time. We cover aspects of reef structure and health but also discuss the diversity of physical environmental data such as temperature, winds, solar radiation and water quality. There have been numerous recent advances in the remote sensing of reefs and we hope that this paper enhances awareness of the diverse data sources available, and helps practitioners identify realistic objectives for remote sensing in coral reef areas. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Ecology plays a central role in the management and conservation of ecosystems. However, as coral restoration emerges as an increasingly popular method of confronting the global decline of tropical coral reefs, an ecological basis to guide restoration remains under-developed. Here, we examine potential contributions that trophic ecology can make to reef restoration efforts. To do so, we conducted a comprehensive review of 519 peer-reviewed restoration studies from the past thirty years. From our review, we quantified how various important trophic interactions have been considered by restoration practitioners to date and discuss how they may be utilized to benefit coral restoration. We found that despite rapidly growing interest in coral restoration, only 15% of restoration publications considered trophic interactions, highlighting a clear mismatch between the fundamental role of trophic ecology on coral reefs and its consideration in restoration efforts. Herbivory was by far the most commonly studied process (46 publications) while other processes such as corallivory (17 publications), coral heterotrophy (8 publications), and consumer-derived nutrient cycling (4 publications) received far less attention despite their known importance on reefs. To promote consideration of these important processes in restoration, we consider how specific trophic interactions within each of these areas can be leveraged through direct and indirect pathways to benefit coral restoration. Ultimately, we argue that rather than considering important trophic interactions as emergent outcomes of reef restoration, practitioners utilize the lessons learned from trophic ecology to help achieve their desired restoration outcomes.},

abstract = {Coral reefs underpin a range of ecosystem goods and services that contribute to the well-being of millions of people. However, tropical coral reefs in the Anthropocene are likely to be functionally different from reefs in the past. In this perspective piece, we ask, what does the Anthropocene mean for the provision of ecosystem services from coral reefs? First, we provide examples of the provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services underpinned by coral reef ecosystems. We conclude that coral reef ecosystem service research has lagged behind multidisciplinary advances in broader ecosystem services science, such as an explicit recognition that interactions between social and ecological systems underpin ecosystem services. Second, drawing on tools from functional ecology, we outline how these social–ecological relationships can be incorporated into a mechanistic understanding of service provision and how this might be used to anticipate future changes in coral reef ecosystem services. Finally, we explore the emergence of novel reef ecosystem services, for example from tropicalized coastlines, or through changing technological connections to coral reefs. Indeed, when services are conceived as coming from social–ecological system dynamics, novelty in services can emerge from elements of the interactions between people and the ecosystem. This synthesis of the coral reef ecosystem services literature suggests the field is poorly prepared to understand the changing service provision anticipated in the Anthropocene. A new research agenda is needed that better connects reef functional ecology to ecosystem service provision. This research agenda should embrace more holistic approaches to ecosystem service research, recognizing them as co-produced by ecosystems and society. Importantly, the likelihood of novel ecosystem service configurations requires further conceptualization and empirical assessment. As with current ecosystem services, the loss or gain of services will not affect all people equally and must be understood in the context in which they occur. With the uncertainty surrounding the future of coral reefs in the Anthropocene, research exploring how the benefits to people change will be of great importance.

abstract = {There are many marine protected areas (MPAs) containing coral reef aggregations in the eastern Pacific region. However, the connectivity of corals between MPAs is still poorly known, especially in the Marine Conservation Corridor of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (MCCETP). Here, we assess the potential connectivity of corals across equatorial eastern Pacific MPAs through a Lagrangian particle-tracking algorithm coupled offline with an ocean-circulation numerical model. Connectivity metrics and graph theory were used to analyze the networks and highlight those MPAs that are critical for maintaining the connectivity of corals across the region. Our results show that the equatorial eastern Pacific MPAs form a relatively well-connected network, at least 40% of coral larvae released per year end up within the boundaries of an MPA. MPAs like Malpelo and Gorgona islands included in the MCCETP were found to be critical for connectivity of corals because of their high betweenness centrality and potential role as stepping-stones between coastal MPAs and offshore MPAs such as the Galapagos Islands. Two pelagic larval duration (PLD) scenarios (40 and 130 days) indicate a quasi-unidirectional larval flow from coastal MPAs toward oceanic MPAs, where the only resilient MPAs (Coiba and Malpelo islands) depend mostly on subsidiary recruitment from MPAs located along the coast of Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. In the two PLD scenarios, Cocos Island maintains a very low resilience potential. Our results indicate the imperative need to include coastal MPAs in the MCCETP network initiative, since connectivity and resilience of coral reefs in the equatorial eastern Pacific region rely heavily on coastal MPAs.},

The widespread degradation of coral reefs, which will be accelerated by climate change, jeopardizes the goods and services that tropical nations derive from reef ecosystems. However, climate change impacts to reef social–ecological systems can also be bi-directional. For example, some climate impacts, such as storms and sea level rise, can directly impact societies, with repercussions for how they interact with the environment. This study identifies the multiple impact pathways within coral reef social–ecological systems arising from four key climatic drivers: increased sea surface temperature, severe tropical storms, sea level rise and ocean acidification. We develop a novel framework for investigating climate change impacts in social–ecological systems, which helps to highlight the diverse impacts that must be considered in order to develop a more complete understanding of the impacts of climate change, as well as developing appropriate management actions to mitigate climate change impacts on coral reef and people.},

abstract = {The use of phylogenies in ecology is increasingly common and has broadened our understanding of biological diversity. Ecological sub-disciplines, particularly conservation, community ecology and macroecology, all recognize the value of evolutionary relationships but the resulting development of phylogenetic approaches has led to a proliferation of phylogenetic diversity metrics. The use of many metrics across the sub-disciplines hampers potential meta-analyses, syntheses, and generalizations of existing results. Further, there is no guide for selecting the appropriate metric for a given question, and different metrics are frequently used to address similar questions. To improve the choice, application, and interpretation of phylo-diversity metrics, we organize existing metrics by expanding on a unifying framework for phylogenetic information. Generally, questions about phylogenetic relationships within or between assemblages tend to ask three types of question: how much; how different; or how regular? We show that these questions reflect three dimensions of a phylogenetic tree: richness, divergence, and regularity. We classify 70 existing phylo-diversity metrics based on their mathematical form within these three dimensions and identify ‘anchor' representatives: for $\alpha$-diversity metrics these are PD (Faith's phylogenetic diversity), MPD (mean pairwise distance), and VPD (variation of pairwise distances). By analysing mathematical formulae and using simulations, we use this framework to identify metrics that mix dimensions, and we provide a guide to choosing and using the most appropriate metrics. We show that metric choice requires connecting the research question with the correct dimension of the framework and that there are logical approaches to selecting and interpreting metrics. The guide outlined herein will help researchers navigate the current jungle of indices.},

However, in a literature review, we find little empirical support for the notion of managed resilience. We outline some reasons for why marine protected areas and the protection of herbivorous fish (especially parrotfish) have had little effect on coral resilience. One key explanation is that the impacts of local stressors (e.g., pollution and fishing) are often swamped by the much greater effect of ocean warming on corals. Another is the sheer complexity (including numerous context dependencies) of the five cascading links assumed by the managed-resilience hypothesis. If reefs cannot be saved by local actions alone, then it is time to face reef degradation head-on, by directly addressing anthropogenic climate change—the root cause of global coral decline.},

abstract = {Ecological selection is a major driver of community assembly. Selection is classified as stabilizing when species with intermediate trait values gain the highest reproductive success, whereas selection is considered directional when fitness is highest for species with extreme trait values. Previous studies have investigated the effects of different selection types on trait distribution, but the effects of selection on species diversity have remained unclear. Here, we propose a framework for inferring the type and strength of selection by studying species diversity and trait distribution together against null expectations. We use a simulation model to confirm our prediction that directional selection should lead to lower species diversity than stabilizing selection despite a similar effect on trait community-weighted variance. We apply the framework to a mesocosm system of annual plants to test whether differences in species diversity between two habitats that vary in productivity are related to differences in selection on seed mass. We show that, in both habitats, species diversity was lower than the null expectation, but that species diversity was lower in the more productive habitat. We attribute this difference to strong directional selection for large-seeded species in the productive habitat as indicated by trait community-weighted mean being higher and community-weighted variance being lower than the null expectations. In the less productive habitat, we found that community-weighted variance was higher than expected by chance, suggesting that seed mass could be a driver of niche partitioning under such conditions. Altogether, our results suggest that viewing species diversity and trait distribution as interrelated patterns driven by the same process, ecological selection, is helpful in understanding community assembly.},

abstract = {Commercial fishing and climate change have influenced the composition of marine fish assemblages worldwide, but we require a better understanding of their relative influence on long-term changes in species abundance and body-size distributions. In this study, we investigated long-term (1911-2007) variability within a demersal fish assemblage in the western English Channel. The region has been subject to commercial fisheries throughout most of the past century, and has undergone interannual changes in sea temperature of over 2.0 °C. We focussed on a core 30 species that comprised 99% of total individuals sampled in the assemblage. Analyses showed that temporal trends in the abundance of smaller multispecies size classes followed thermal regime changes, but that there were persistent declines in abundance of larger size classes. Consistent with these results, larger-growing individual species had the greatest declines in body size, and the most constant declines in abundance, while abundance changes of smaller-growing species were more closely linked to preceding sea temperatures. Together these analyses are suggestive of dichotomous size-dependent responses of species to long-term climate change and commercial fishing over a century scale. Small species had rapid responses to the prevailing thermal environment, suggesting their life history traits predisposed populations to respond quickly to changing climates. Larger species declined in abundance and size, reflecting expectations from sustained size-selective overharvesting. These results demonstrate the importance of considering species traits when developing indicators of human and climatic impacts on marine fauna. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Euclidean distance is commonly involved in calculating functional diversity (FD), for example, in measures based on dendrogram branch lengths. We point out that this function is inappropriate in many cases and that the choice of clustering method is more crucial than earlier thought. Gower's formula and UPGMA clustering are suggested here as a standard combination of techniques for calculating FD. The advantage of Gower's measure is its suitability to a mixture of scale types and its tolerance to missing values. Examples demonstrate that UPGMA clustering is more robust and has a better goodness of fit to dissimilarities than complete and single linkage classifications. In addition, we propose that the effect of individual species on FD is best evaluated by species removals and subsequent comparisons of tree length values. The influence of each functional trait is optimally judged by considering both dendrogram length and topological changes. {\textcopyright} OIKOS.},

abstract = {Around the globe, coral reefs and other marine ecosystems are increasingly overfished. Conventionally, studies of fishing impacts have focused on the population size and dynamics of targeted stocks rather than the broader ecosystem-wide effects of harvesting. Using parrotfishes as an example, we show how coral reef fish populations respond to escalating fishing pressure across the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Based on these fish abundance data, we infer the potential impact on four key functional roles performed by parrotfishes. Rates of bioerosion and coral predation are highly sensitive to human activity, whereas grazing and sediment removal are resilient to fishing. Our results offer new insights into the vulnerability and resilience of coral reefs to the ever-growing human footprint. The depletion of fishes causes differential decline of key ecosystem functions, radically changing the dynamics of coral reefs and setting the stage for future ecological surprises. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {The inherent complexity of high-diversity systems can make them particularly difficult to understand. The relatively recent introduction of functional approaches, which seek to infer ecosystem functioning based on species' ecological traits, has revolutionized our understanding of these high-diversity systems. Today, the functional structure of an assemblage is widely regarded as a key indicator of the status or resilience of an ecosystem. Indeed, functional evaluations have become a mainstay of monitoring and management approaches. But is the heavy focus on broad metrics of functional structure grounded in empirical research? On tropical coral reefs, the ocean's most diverse ecosystems, remarkably few studies directly quantify ecosystem functions and the term ‘function' is widely used but rarely defined, especially when applied to reef fishes. Our review suggests that most ‘functional' studies do not study function as it relates to ecological processes. Rather, they look at easy-to-measure traits or proxies that are thought to have functional significance. However, these links are rarely tested empirically, severely limiting our capacity to extend results from community structure to the dynamic processes operating within high-diversity ecosystems such as coral reefs. With rapid changes in global ecosystems, and in their capacity to deliver ecosystem services, there is an urgent need to understand and empirically measure the role of organisms in various ecosystem functions. We suggest that if we are to understand and manage transitioning coral reefs in the Anthropocene, a broad definition of the word ‘function' is needed along with a focus on ecological processes and the empirical quantification of functional roles. In this review, we propose a universal operational definition of the term ‘function' that works from a cellular to a global level. Specifically, it is the movement or storage of energy or material. Within this broad definitional framework, all functions are part of a continuum that is tied together by the process-based unifier of material fluxes. With this universal definition at hand, we then present a path forward that will allow us to fully harness the power of functional approaches in understanding and managing high-diversity systems such as coral reefs. A plain language summary is available for this article.},

abstract = {Maintaining coral reef resilience against increasing anthropogenic disturbance is critical for effective reef management. Resilience is partially determined by how processes, such as herbivory and nutrient supply, affect coral recovery versus macroalgal proliferation following disturbances. However, the relative effects of herbivory versus nutrient enrichment on algal proliferation remain debated. Here, we manipulated herbivory and nutrients on a coral-dominated reef protected from fishing, and on an adjacent macroalgal-dominated reef subject to fishing and riverine discharge, over 152 days. On both reefs, herbivore exclusion increased total and upright macroalgal cover by 9-46 times, upright macroalgal biomass by 23-84 times, and cyanobacteria cover by 0-27 times, but decreased cover of encrusting coralline algae by 46-100% and short turf algae by 14-39%. In contrast, nutrient enrichment had no effect on algal proliferation, but suppressed cover of total macroalgae (by 33-42%) and cyanobacteria (by 71% on the protected reef) when herbivores were excluded. Herbivore exclusion, but not nutrient enrichment, also increased sediment accumulation, suggesting a strong link between herbivory, macroalgal growth, and sediment retention. Growth rates of the corals Porites cylindrica and Acropora millepora were 30-35% greater on the protected versus fished reef, but nutrient and herbivore manipulations within a site did not affect coral growth. Cumulatively, these data suggest that herbivory rather than eutrophication plays the dominant role in mediating macroalgal proliferation, that macroalgae trap sediments that may further suppress herbivory and enhance macroalgal dominance, and that corals are relatively resistant to damage from some macroalgae but are significantly impacted by ambient reef condition. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The Gulf of California (GC) is a semi-closed sea in the Tropical Eastern Pacific and is recognised as a highly diverse marine ecosystem. Despite this status, this region is still poorly studied in comparison to other marine hotspots. To start filling this gap, we attempt to provide a global overview of reef-fish diversity around the numerous islands of the region. We evaluated species richness, the abundance and biomass, and the functional diversity of the fish assemblages for the major islands of the GC. We first highlight that the southwestern part of the central GC is the hotspot of reef-fishes diversity within the GC, in terms of species richness, functional diversity, and fish abundance. We then found out an important functional divergence between fish assemblages of northern and southern regions. The fish biomass of each region is dominated by different species, characterised by different ecological traits (the opposite of functional convergence). This functional divergence may be explained by an important oceanographic heterogeneity along the latitudinal axis of the GC. The northern part shows larger climate fluctuations while the southern part is more tropical and climatically stable. Such functional divergence is a biodiversity facet to take into account when determining the sites to focus conservation action. In the GC, this criterion allows the importance of some sites to be highlighted to preserve the legacy of the reef-fishes, despite their lower diversity levels.},

@article{Dethier1994,
abstract = {Encrusting marine algae are found at all depths in the photic zone from polar to tropical seas worldwide, yet little is known about their ecology. Crusts (including red, brown, and green algae as well as lichens and Cyanobacteria) tend to predominate in areas of high disturbance (e.g. from herbivores or sand scour) or high stress ( = low potential productivity, e.g. high on the shore). Patterns of crust and herbivore distribution and abundance were quantified in the intertidal zone in Washington state, and then the two environmental parameters predicted to be critical to among-crust variation in survival were manipulated: disturbance potential by varying abundances of herbivores, or by eliminating herbivores and artificially disturbing crusts with nylon and steel brushes; productivity potential by transplanting crusts along an environmental gradient from the high to the low intertidal zone and onto a submerged raft. Within-functional-group variation among crusts was studied by transplanting eight species (varying in calcification, thickness, tightness of construction, and other characters), and measuring their survival and growth over 2-3 yr in the different environments. Crusts varied widely in their responses to both disturbance and productivity potential. In general, thick, calcified, or very tightly constructed crusts withstood being steel-brushed at regular intervals. Nylon brushing sometimes actually benefitted these crusts relative to the controls (unbrushed but cleaned monthly), probably because of the reduction in fouling. In contrast, thinner or more loosely-constructed species showed poor survival when steel-brushed and often suffered significant losses even when nylon-brushed. Most crusts tended to do best in habitats having higher productivity potential (lower intertidal zone), showing mortality or reduced growth when transplanted into more stressful areas, although two species were healthiest under "stressful" conditions, i.e. desiccated or submerged in high pools. Experiments in the laboratory with herbivores (littorinid snails, limpets, and a chiton) demonstrated that they did not always consume the species that are mechanically easiest to remove (as indicated by the steel brushing experiments). Three species were avoided, including a brown known to contain high concentrations of phenolics, a blue-green crust, and a lichen with a blue-green phycobiont. All crusts grew very slowly, even in their optimal habitats; the fastest species grew laterally at < 20 mm/yr, and the slowest measurable at < 0.5 mm/yr. Some species showed no lateral growth over 2 yr. This low ability to sequester space, and their two-dimensional growth form, means that crusts often rely on grazers or other disturbance to keep from being overgrown. In other cases, they grow in areas where desiccation or low light levels apparently eliminate other algal forms. Crusts survive disturbance by either resisting it (through calcification or toughness), tolerating it (by being thick or regenerating rapidly), or avoiding it (by having an opportunistic life history, living in refugia such as crevices or high tidepools, or being unpalatable). Their life histories are highly variable, allowing them to exploit habitats in different ways. For example, in the mid intertidal zone in Washington the three dominant crust species include: (1) a fast-growing, frequently-recruiting brown (Ralfsia pacifica Hollenberg) that senesces after several years and sloughs away; (2) a fast-growing but rarely-recruiting red ("Petrocelis") that lives for decades; and (3) a very slow-growing and rarely-recruiting red [Hildenbrandia rubra (Sommerfelt) Meneghini] that persists even when overgrown, and regenerates following disturbance. These diverse morphologies and life history strategies help make this morphology an ecological success. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Constrained multivariate analysis is a common tool for linking ecological communities to environment. The follow-up is the development of the double-constrained correspondence analysis (dc-CA), integrating traits as species-related predictors. Further, methods have been proposed to integrate information on phylogenetic relationships and space variability. We expand this framework, proposing a dc-CA-based algorithm for decomposing variation in community structure and testing the simple and conditional effects of four sets of predictors: environment characteristics and space configuration as predictors related to sites, while traits and niche (dis)similarities as species-related predictors. In our approach, ecological niches differ from traits in that the latter are distinguished by and characterize the individual level, while niches are measured on the species level, and when compared, they are characteristics of communities and should be used as separate predictors. The novelties of this approach are the introduction of new niche parameters, niche dissimilarities, synthetic niche-based diversity which we related to environmental features, the development of an algorithm for the full variation decomposition and testing of the community–environment–niche–traits–space (CENTS) space by dc-CAs with and without covariates, and new types of diagrams for the results. Applying these methods to a dataset on freshwater mollusks, we learned that niche predictors may be as important as traits in explaining community structure and are not redundant, overweighting the environmental and spatial predictors. Our algorithm opens new pathways for developing integrative methods linking life, environment, and other predictors, both in theoretical and practical applications, including assessment of human impact on habitats and ecological systems.},

abstract = {Coral and macroalgal communities are threatened by global stressors. However, recently reported community shifts from temperate macroalgae to tropical corals offer conservation potential for corals at the expense of macroalgae under climate warming. Although such community shifts are expanding geographically, our understanding of the driving processes is still limited. Here, we reconstruct long-term climate-driven range shifts in 45 species of macroalgae, corals, and herbivorous fishes from over 60 years of records (mainly 1950–2015), stretching across 3,000 km of the Japanese archipelago from tropical to subarctic zones. Based on a revised coastal version of climate velocity trajectories, we found that prediction models combining the effects of climate and ocean currents consistently explained observed community shifts significantly better than those relying on climate alone. Corals and herbivorous fishes performed better at exploiting opportunities offered by this interaction. The contrasting range dynamics for these taxa suggest that ocean warming is promoting macroalgal-to-coral shifts both directly by increased competition from the expansion of tropical corals into the contracting temperate macroalgae, and indirectly via deforestation by the expansion of tropical herbivorous fish. Beyond individual species' effects, our results provide evidence on the important role that the interaction between climate warming and external forces conditioning the dispersal of organisms, such as ocean currents, can have in shaping community-level responses, with concomitant changes to ecosystem structure and functioning. Furthermore, we found that community shifts from macroalgae to corals might accelerate with future climate warming, highlighting the complexity of managing these evolving communities under future climate change.},

How do these gradients affect functional composition in early successional plant communities and to what extent? Can we accurately predict trait composition from knowledge of these gradients?Location: Southern Quebec, Canada.Methods: Using eight environmental variables measured in 48 early successional plant communities, we estimated stress and disturbance gradients through structural equation modelling. We then measured 10 functional traits on the most abundant species of these 48 communities and calculated their community-level mean and variance weighted by the relative abundance of each species. Finally, we related these community-weighted means and variances to the estimated stress and disturbance gradients using general linear models or generalized additive models.Results: We obtained a well-fitting measurement model of the stress and disturbance gradients existing in our sites. Of the 10 studied traits, only average plant reproductive height was strongly correlated with the stress (r2=0.464) and disturbance (r2=0.543) gradients. Leaf traits were not significantly related to either the stress or disturbance gradients.Conclusions: The well-fitting measurement model of the stress and disturbance gradients, combined with the generally weak trait-environment linkages, suggests that community assembly in these early successional plant communities is driven primarily by stochastic processes linked to the history of arrival of propagules and not to trait-based environmental filtering. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

Additionally, there are only a few papers relating the protection level of marine protected areas (MPAs) with functional diversity. In this study, we calculate the functional diversity of echinoids and asteroids in 11 coral and rocky reefs with different protection levels across the Mexican Pacific. We recorded the abundance of 15 echinoderm species comprising seven echinoid and eight asteroid species. More than 30 morphological and ecological traits of the censused species were evaluated to calculate two functional diversity indices: Rao's quadratic entropy index (FDQ) and functional richness (FRic). Latitudinal patterns of functional diversity differed between groups. Asteroids showed the highest FDQ and FRic values in the Gulf of California. Echinoids showed FDQ peaks at the highest (Bah{\'{i}}a de los {\'{A}}ngeles; 28° 56′, − 113° 30′), and the lowest latitude (Bah{\'{i}}as de Huatulco; 15° 43′, − 98° 08′) sites. The Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo site (17° 39′, − 101° 36′) had the highest FRic values. Generalized linear mixed models showed that protection level did not have any significant effect on FDQ or FRic. Latitude, on the other hand, did have a significant effect on asteroid functional diversity, although no significant effects were found for echinoids. The lack of an effect of protection level, and the support of a latitudinal gradient in terms of both taxonomic and functional diversity, has important implications for conservation efforts, supporting the idea of a protected area network to maintain adequate regional biodiversity.},

abstract = {Octopus insularis, despite being widely fished from Brazil to Mexico, has only recently been described as a different species from the sympatric Octopus vulgaris complex in the tropical Atlantic, where its occurrence is determined by different environmental factors. Using a 10-year time series from Brazil, we modeled how topographic aspects and oceanographic variables affected the landings of O. insularis. For that we used a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) technique and residual autocovariate-boosted regression trees (RAC-BRTs). In addition to the octopus landing per unit effort (LPUE) being driven by the seafloor structure, we also observed that it was directly related to the temperature and inversely related to chlorophyll. Higher LPUEs were observed in warmer years. Although the relationship between LPUE and chlorophyll or temperature has not yet been explained under laboratorial conditions, the higher catches observed at higher temperatures may be both a result of the local fishing dynamics and a warning toward the possibility of future niche expansion, due to climate change. If the latter is confirmed, octopus fisheries in parts of the South Atlantic would need to adapt to a smaller, and thus cheaper, body-sized species.},

The newly created Las Perlas marine protected area (1688 km2), the second largest archipelago in the TEP, fills a regional conservation gap for the protection of reefs and potentially becomes the second highest coral diversity area in the MCCTEP. This study describes the distribution of live coral cover and species alpha-diversity over 307 ha of shallow coral reefs and coral communities in the Las Perlas Archipelago. Nineteen scleractinian and 38 octocorals were observed, including species previously thought to be uncommon. Although coral communities generally had a greater number of species than coral reefs, species richness did not differ between habitats. However, their coral and octocoral composition and benthic makeup (coral cover, macroalgae, sponge, etc.) differed. The reefs had higher live coral cover (61.2%) and lower algal cover (32.5%) than the coral communities (26.0% and 65.7%, respectively). Octocorals were more common in the communities than on the reefs. There was a negative relationship between live coral cover and species richness, low to moderate cover generally coinciding with coral community sites and higher species richness. Areas are recommended for marine reserve zoning within the new Las Perlas marine protected area to ensure the protection of important habitats and maintenance of diversity in the TEP, both highlighting the importance of the southern islands of the archipelago for coral diversity and the northern islands for their high live coral cover. Review of the representativeness of regional coral diversity would facilitate better design of small-scale reserves across the TEP, following comparable survey methods. {\textcopyright} 2008 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.},

abstract = {We suggest that relatively few species attributes are of overriding importance to the structure of benthic marine algal communities and that these are often shared among taxonomically distant species. Data from the western North Atlantic, eastern North Pacific and Caribbean suggest that patterns in algal biomass, diversity and dominance are strikingly convergent when examined at a functional group level relative to the productivity and herbivore-induced disturbance potentials of the environment. We present a simple graphical model that provides a way to predict algal community composition based on these two environmental axes. This predictability stems from algal functional groups having characteristic rates of mass-specific productivity, thallus longevity and canopy height that cause them to “behave” in similar ways. Further, herbivore-induced disturbances have functionally similar impacts on most morphologically and anatomically similar algae regardless of their taxonomic or geographic affinities. Strategies identified for marine algae parallel those of a terrestrial scheme with the addition of disturbance-tolerant plants that characteristically coexist with and even thrive under high levels of disturbance. Algal-dominated communities, when examined at the functional group level, appear to be much more temporally stable and predictable than when examined at the species level},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Tropical reefs have been subjected to a range of anthropogenic pressures such as global climate change, overfishing and eutrophication that have raised questions about the prominence of macroalgae on tropical reefs, whether they pose a threat to biodiversity, and how they may influence the function of tropical marine ecosystems. We synthesise current understanding of the structure and function of tropical macroalgal reefs and how they may support various ecosystem goods and services. We then forecast how key stressors may alter the role of macroalgal reefs in tropical seascapes of the Anthropocene. High levels of primary productivity from tropical canopy macroalgae, which rivals that of other key producers (e.g., corals and turf algae), can be widely dispersed across tropical seascapes to provide a boost of secondary productivity in a range of biomes that include coral reefs, and support periodic harvests of macroalgal biomass for industrial and agricultural uses. Complex macroalgal reefs that comprise a mixture of canopy and understorey taxa can also provide key habitats for a diverse community of epifauna, as well as juvenile and adult fishes that are the basis for important tropical fisheries. Key macroalgal taxa (e.g., Sargassum) that form complex macroalgal reefs are likely to be sensitive to future climate change. Increases in maximum sea temperature, in particular, could depress biomass production and/or drive phenological shifts in canopy formation that will affect their capacity to support tropical marine ecosystems. Macroalgal reefs can support a suite of tropical marine ecosystem functions when embedded within an interconnected mosaic of habitat types. Habitat connectivity is, therefore, essential if we are to maintain tropical marine biodiversity alongside key ecosystem goods and services. Consequently, complex macroalgal reefs should be treated as a key ecological asset in strategies for the conservation and management of diverse tropical seascapes.

abstract = {Argues that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging from the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. -from Author},

Confronting large-scale crises requires a major scaling-up of management efforts based on an improved understanding of the ecological processes that underlie reef resilience. Managing for improved resilience, incorporating the role of human activity in shaping ecosystems, provides a basis for coping with uncertainty, future changes and ecological surprises. Here we review the ecological roles of critical functional groups (for both corals and reef fishes) that are fundamental to understanding resilience and avoiding phase shifts from coral dominance to less desirable, degraded ecosystems. We identify striking biogeographic differences in the species richness and composition of functional groups, which highlight the vulnerability of Caribbean reef ecosystems. These findings have profound implications for restoration of degraded reefs, management of fisheries, and the focus on marine protected areas and biodiversity hotspots as priorities for conservation.},

abstract = {Climate-driven changes in biotic interactions can profoundly alter ecological communities, particularly when they impact foundation species. In marine systems, changes in herbivory and the consequent loss of dominant habitat forming species can result in dramatic community phase shifts, such as from coral to macroalgal dominance when tropical fish herbivory decreases, and from algal forests to 'barrens' when temperate urchin grazing increases. Here, we propose a novel phase-shift away from macroalgal dominance caused by tropical herbivores extending their range into temperate regions. We argue that this phase shift is facilitated by poleward-flowing boundary currents that are creating ocean warming hotspots around the globe, enabling the range expansion of tropical species and increasing their grazing rates in temperate areas. Overgrazing of temperate macroalgae by tropical herbivorous fishes has already occurred in Japan and the Mediterranean. Emerging evidence suggests similar phenomena are occurring in other temperate regions, with increasing occurrence of tropical fishes on temperate reefs. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

For 2006, the marine protected surface was 5 208.8km2, with 331.5km of coastline, in 20 protected areas. The country has made progress on the conservation priority sites identification for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity, with few efforts on marine planning. This research presents the analysis and results of the gap identification process, for marine and coastal biodiversity conservation in the protected areas system of Costa Rica. The analysis was built with the spatial information available on the presence and distribution of coastal and marine biodiversity, the establishment of the conservation goals and a threat analysis over the ecological integrity of this biodiversity. The selection of high-priority sites was carried out using spatial optimization techniques and the superposition over the current shape of marine protected areas, in order to identify representation gaps. A total of 19 076km2 of conservation gaps were indentified, with 1 323km2 in the Caribbean and 17 753km2 in the Pacific. Recommendations are aimed at planning and strengthening the marine protected areas system, using the gaps identified as a framework. It is expected that the results of this study would be the scientific base needed for planning and sustainable use of marine biodiversity in the country.},

The spatial and temporal trends of functional diversity exploited from the LMEs were calculated using global reconstructed marine fisheries catch data provided by the Sea Around Us initiative (including subsistence, artisanal, recreational, industrial fisheries, and discards) and functional trait data available in FishBase. Our analyses uncovered a substantial increase in the functional richness of both ray-finned fishes (80% of LMEs) and cartilaginous species (sharks and rays) (75% of LMESs), in line with an increase in the taxonomic richness, extracted from these ecosystems. The functional evenness and functional divergence of these catches have also altered substantially over the time span of this study, with considerable geographic variation in the patterns detected. These trends show that global fisheries are increasingly targeting species that play diverse roles within the marine ecosystem and underline the importance of incorporating functional diversity in ecosystem management.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

abstract = {This paper develops a framework for the study of climate on fish populations based on first principles of physiology, ecology, and available observations. Environmental variables and oceanographic features that are relevant to fish and that are likely to be affected by climate change are reviewed. Working hypotheses are derived from the differences in the expected response of different species groups. A review of published data on Northeast Atlantic fish species representing different biogeographic affinities, habitats, and body size lends support to the hypothesis that global warming results in a shift in abundance and distribution (in patterns of occurrence with latitude and depth) of fish species. Pelagic species exhibit clear changes in seasonal migration patterns related to climate-induced changes in zooplankton productivity. Lusitanian species have increased in recent decades (sprat, anchovy, and horse mackerel), especially at the northern limit of their distribution areas, while Boreal species decreased at the southern limit of their distribution range (cod and plaice), but increased at the northern limit (cod). Although the underlying mechanisms remain uncertain, available evidence suggests climate-related changes in recruitment success to be the key process, stemming from either higher production or survival in the pelagic egg or larval stage, or owing to changes in the quality/quantity of nursery habitats. {\textcopyright}2009 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

abstract = {Diversity patterns are determined by biogeographic, energetic, and anthropogenic factors, yet few studies have combined them into a large-scale framework in order to decouple and compare their relative effects on fish faunas. Using an empirical dataset derived from 1527 underwater visual censuses (UVC) at 18 oceanic islands (five different marine provinces), we determined the relative influence of such factors on reef fish species richness, functional dispersion, density and biomass estimated from each UVC unit. Species richness presented low variation but was high at large island sites. High functional dispersion, density, and biomass were found at islands with large local species pool and distance from nearest reef. Primary productivity positively affected fish richness, density and biomass confirming that more productive areas support larger populations, and higher biomass and richness on oceanic islands. Islands densely populated by humans had lower fish species richness and biomass reflecting anthropogenic effects. Species richness, functional dispersion, and biomass were positively related to distance from the mainland. Overall, species richness and fish density were mainly influenced by biogeographical and energetic factors, whereas functional dispersion and biomass were strongly influenced by anthropogenic factors. Our results extend previous hypotheses for different assemblage metrics estimated from empirical data and confirm the negative impact of humans on fish assemblages, highlighting the need for conservation of oceanic islands.},

abstract = {We propose an integrated sampling, rarefaction, and extrapolation methodology to compare species richness of a set of communities based on samples of equal completeness (as measured by sample coverage) instead of equal size. Traditional rarefaction or extrapolation to equal-sized samples can misrepresent the relationships between the richnesses of the communities being compared because a sample of a given size may be sufficient to fully characterize the lower diversity community, but insufficient to characterize the richer community. Thus, the traditional method systematically biases the degree of differences between community richnesses. We derived a new analytic method for seamless coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation. We show that this method yields less biased comparisons of richness between communities, and manages this with less total sampling effort. When this approach is integrated with an adaptive coverage-based stopping rule during sampling, samples may be compared directly without rarefaction, so no extra data is taken and none is thrown away. Even if this stopping rule is not used during data collection, coveragebased rarefaction throws away less data than traditional size-based rarefaction, and more efficiently finds the correct ranking of communities according to their true richnesses. Several hypothetical and real examples demonstrate these advantages. {\textcopyright}2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Octopus insularis, despite being widely fished from Brazil to Mexico, has only recently been described as a different species from the sympatric Octopus vulgaris complex in the tropical Atlantic, where its occurrence is determined by different environmental factors. Using a 10-year time series from Brazil, we modeled how topographic aspects and oceanographic variables affected the landings of O. insularis. For that we used a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) technique and residual autocovariate-boosted regression trees (RAC-BRTs). In addition to the octopus landing per unit effort (LPUE) being driven by the seafloor structure, we also observed that it was directly related to the temperature and inversely related to chlorophyll. Higher LPUEs were observed in warmer years. Although the relationship between LPUE and chlorophyll or temperature has not yet been explained under laboratorial conditions, the higher catches observed at higher temperatures may be both a result of the local fishing dynamics and a warning toward the possibility of future niche expansion, due to climate change. If the latter is confirmed, octopus fisheries in parts of the South Atlantic would need to adapt to a smaller, and thus cheaper, body-sized species.},

While both environmental conditions and evolutionary history shape trait biogeography, their relative contributions are largely unknown for most organisms. Here, we explore the global biogeography of reef fish traits for 2,786 species from 89 ecoregions spanning eight marine realms with contrasting environmental conditions and evolutionary histories. Across realms, we found a common structure in the distribution of species traits despite a 10-fold gradient in species richness, with a defined “backbone” of 21 trait combinations shared by all realms globally, both temperate and tropical. Across ecoregions, assemblages under similar environmental conditions had similar trait compositions despite hosting drastically different species pools from separate evolutionary lineages. Thus, despite being separated by thousands of kilometers and millions of years of evolution, similar environments host similar trait compositions in reef fish assemblages worldwide. Our findings suggest that similar trait-based management strategies can be applied among regions with distinct species pools, potentially improving conservation outcomes across diverse jurisdictions.},

Live coral coverage has decreased compared to previous reports for the area. Sea urchins were the macroinvertebrates with the highest densities, while species of commercial interest presented low densities, this may suggest some degree of fishing pressure. 84 reef fish species were identified, making the islands area with the greatest diversity of reef fish in the North Pacific of Costa Rica.

abstract = {We examined the geographic distributions of 1135 species of resident shore fishes to assess biogeographic subdivision of the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP), which stretches from the Gulf of California to northern Peru. Using hierarchical clustering refined by Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM), we determined geographic groupings in the distributions of the entire fauna, of regional endemics and of 3 functional (habitat) groups of species. We also examined the distributions of local endemics throughout the TEP and how differences in faunal size versus faunal composition among sites contribute to the subdivision pattern. Our results indicate that: (1) the continental coast contains 2 provinces, the Cortez (Gulf of California and lower Pacific Baja) and the Panamic (southward), each of which has a peak in abundance of local endemics and of overall species richness; (2) the northern and southern boundaries of the TEP are located near Magdalena Bay on Baja California (̃25° N) and the southern shore of the Gulf of Guayaquil (̃4° S), respectively; and (3) the 5 oceanic islands/archipelagos collectively represent a third, Ocean Island Province. Relative to mainland areas, the fauna of the ocean islands is smaller, has a different functional-group composition, and includes more transpacific species and more highly localized endemics. The 3-province pattern probably developed in response to the formation of the Gulf of California, the rise of the Isthmus of Panama, immigration from the north, south and west to the TEP, and differing environmental conditions between and within provinces. In contrast, barriers to dispersal within this geographically simple region are weak and likely had much less influence. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract = {Water is the key determinant factor of ecosystem balance, especially in hot desert regions facing multiple climatic and edaphic constraints. In the Sahara Desert, vegetation associated to man-made mesic environments such as open-air irrigation channels and oases is little studied. In order to understand the vegetation–water relationship in xeric environments, the present study focused on estimating diversity and determining functional traits of plant communities established around water points developed near water towers in the region of Adrar (Sahara Desert of Algeria). Based on data collected from 31 phytoecological relev{\'{e}}s, spontaneous vegetation was analyzed using diversity parameters (viz. species richness, diversity, richness estimation and similarity), and plant functional traits ‘PFT' (viz. life forms, morphological, phytogeographical and dispersal types, Grime's and Noy-Meir's strategies). A total of 4695 individuals belonging to 53 plant species and 23 families were collected. Rarefaction and extrapolation curves applied for all the surveys carried out indicated that the estimated species richness is projected to be 77.2 ± 10 species from 31 survey plots and it is predicted to reach up to 116 ± 30 species from 200 survey plots, which represents an increase of 119% of the observed species richness. According to the real spectrum (abundance-based data) of PFT, plant species are mainly hemicryptophytes (54.12%) and arid-actives (69.97%) that adopt various dispersal strategies including anemochores (57.68%) and barochores (36.68%). Grime's strategies showed the predominance of competitive and stress-tolerant species (52.76%). The phytogeographical analysis revealed the dominance in the strict sense of the Tropical-Mediterranean-Saharo-Arabian element (36.59%) which adapts well to the Saharan climate. This study showed the role of water in shaping the functional characteristics of vegetation in hyper-arid regions. The functional diversity of Saharan vegetation reflects species strategies for a better exploitation of the water and guaranteeing their coexistence in hyper-arid environments.},

Across realms, we found a common structure in the distribution of species traits despite a 10-fold gradient in species richness, with a defined “backbone” of 21 trait combinations shared by all realms globally, both temperate and tropical. Across ecoregions, assemblages under similar environmental conditions had similar trait compositions despite hosting drastically different species pools from separate evolutionary lineages. Thus, despite being separated by thousands of kilometers and millions of years of evolution, similar environments host similar trait compositions in reef fish assemblages worldwide. Our findings suggest that similar trait-based management strategies can be applied among regions with distinct species pools, potentially improving conservation outcomes across diverse jurisdictions.},

abstract = {Cross-species analyses of plant functional traits have shed light on factors contributing to differences in performance and distribution, but to date most studies have focused on either leaves or stems. We extend these tissue-specific analyses of functional strategy towards a whole-plant approach by integrating data on functional traits for 13 448 leaves and wood tissues from 4672 trees representing 668 species of Neotropical trees. Strong correlations amongst traits previously defined as the leaf economics spectrum reflect a tradeoff between investments in productive leaves with rapid turnover vs. costly physical leaf structure with a long revenue stream. A second axis of variation, the 'stem economics spectrum', defines a similar tradeoff at the stem level: dense wood vs. high wood water content and thick bark. Most importantly, these two axes are orthogonal, suggesting that tradeoffs operate independently at the leaf and at the stem levels. By simplifying the multivariate ecological strategies of tropical trees into positions along these two spectra, our results provide a basis to improve global vegetation models predicting responses of tropical forests to global change. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {The study of functional diversity, or the range of species' ecological roles in a community, is a rapidly expanding area in ecology. Given the extent that ecosystems are being altered, effort should shift toward assessing variation in functional diversity across landscapes with the goal of improving land use management decisions. We construct a workflow that creates three-dimensional surfaces and maps of functional diversity to examine changes in beetle functional diversity across an Indiana, USA landscape. We sampled 105 prey wood-borer and predator beetle species along a gradient of forest fragmentation across Indiana and used a number of functional traits from literature sources to capture their functional roles. We developed newly measured functional traits to estimate several traits relevant to beetles' ecological function that was unknown and not easily measured. Functional diversity indices (FRic, FDis, FDiv, and FEve) were calculated from species abundance and functional traits and used to assess changes in functional diversity along the fragmentation gradient. We predicted that habitat fragmentation would have a greater negative impact on predator beetle functional diversity than prey wood-borer functional diversity. Landscape metrics most important to the functional diversity of both wood-borer and predator beetle communities were landscape division index (LDI, an assessment of landscape subdivision) and mean shape index (MSI, a measure of patch shape complexity). Overall, three-dimensional surfaces of functional diversity and functional diversity maps across the Indiana landscape revealed that beetle functional diversity was greatest with minimal landscape subdivision. Opposite to what we predicted, we found that the prey wood-borer functional diversity was more negatively impacted by LDI than the predator beetle functional diversity. Furthermore, predator beetle functional diversity was greater with increasing MSI. The map predicted predator FRic to be highest in forested areas with intact habitat and also less sensitive to habitat fragmentation adjacent to more continuous forest. We propose that land management may be guided by revealing landscapes that are most appropriate for maximizing functional diversity of multiple communities or shifting the relative abundance within prey and beneficial predator beetle functional groups with the use of three-dimensional plots or maps.},

It has approximately 3.5% of the world marine species. In the last four decades, Costa Rica has done a considerable effort to create a representative system of Protected Areas (PA), mainly terrestrial. We present an assessment of the current situation of the Marine Protected Areas (MPA) in Costa Rica, through an historical analysis, and an evaluation of their distribution, coverage and management categories. Costa Rica has 166 protected areas covering 50% of the coastline; of these 20 are MPAs, classified as National Parks (90.6%), National Wildlife Refuges (6.6%), Wetlands (1.5%), Biological Reserves (1%), and one Absolute Natural Reserve (0.3%). According to IUCN criteria, 93.7% correspond to category II, 5% to IV and 1.3% to I. The marine protected surface is 5 296.5km2, corresponding to 17.5% of the territorial waters and 0.9% of the Exclusive Economic Zone. The median distance between MPAs is 22.4km in the Pacific and 32.9km along the Caribbean. The median size is close to 54km2. The main threats to MPAs are the lack of coordination between governmental agencies, limited economic resources, restricted patrolling and control, poor watershed management, and rampant coastal alteration.},

Coral reefs are diverse and productive ecosystems, despite this, they are being threatened by human activities that enhance the detrimental impact of the natural phenomenon's like Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB). The north Pacific of Costa Rica has been characterized as one of the best regions for the coral reefs development in the country. However, many of these ecosystems are being lost as a result of eutrophication, overfishing, invasive species and others impacts that affect the region. In the present study, live coral cover in the north Pacific was 5.0 ± 10.4(s.d.) %, with a domination in the ecosystems by turf algae. Twenty-six invertebrate taxa were registered in the region with the predominance of the sea urchin Diadema mexicanum. Ninety-four species of reef fish were identified. Snappers and some planktivores species were the groups with the highest frequency and abundance. The localities previously studied in the 1990 decade, presented a mean live coral cover between 40-50 %, whereby the actual state of the reef reflect a significant deterioration. This decline in coral cover is due to natural events like the El Ni{\~{n}}o, as well as the decrease in water quality in the region. In recent years, proliferations of the invasive seaweed Caulerpa sertularioides and high densities of bioerosive sea urchins have been reported, mainly associated with HAB events. Likewise, fish communities have low biomass, especially in the vicinity of fishing villages. The state of the reefs in the North Pacific is worrying and requires actions for its recovery and conservation, for which there must be better planning of the development of projects and activities on the coast.

Here we report on a new global system for coastal and shelf areas: the Marine Ecoregions of the World, or MEOW, a nested system of 12 realms, 62 provinces, and 232 ecoregions. This system provides considerably better spatial resolution than earlier global systems, yet it preserves many common elements and can be cross-referenced to many regional biogeographic classifications.

abstract = {Abstract Aim Several drivers explain the global distribution of all reef fish. However, whether these drivers also explain the distribution and traits of a functional subgroup involving cleaner fishes remain unclear. Here we examine the variation in traits of cleaner fishes and test whether historical, environmental, ecological and geographical drivers are correlated with cleaner species richness and abundance at global reefs. Location Tropical and subtropical reefs. Taxon Actinopterygii. Methods We tested whether species traits and trait space vary between facultative (i.e. species that clean only during the juvenile stages or sporadically) and dedicated (i.e. species that clean during their whole lives) cleaner types. We compiled data from local checklists (relative richness) and belt transects (standardized richness and abundance). We built four models to test whether past and current isolation (i.e. distance from Quaternary refugia and biodiversity centres), sea temperature, primary productivity, local species pool and abundance of potential clients influenced the relative richness and abundance of cleaners. Results Facultative cleaners had high trait variability that contributed disproportionally to the trait space, whereas dedicated cleaners exhibited low trait variability. Cleaner species richness was higher in the Indo-Pacific and Caribbean provinces, but the relative richness and standardized abundance of cleaners were higher in the Atlantic (i.e. North Eastern and Southwestern) and Eastern Pacific. Isolation influenced the relative richness of facultative cleaners, whereas the distance to Quaternary refugia, sea temperature and isolation influenced the relative richness of dedicated cleaners. Local species richness and standardized abundance of cleaner fish exhibited a strong relationship with regional diversity. The standardized abundance of both facultative and dedicated cleaners was influenced by the abundance of potential clients and the local species pool. Main conclusions The small trait space occupied by cleaner fishes may reflect their restricted origin among lineages of reef fishes. Differences in the relative richness and standardized abundance of cleaner fishes across marine realms suggest a strong influence on biogeographical history. Our results also indicate that cleaner fishes originated mostly in peripheral areas in high latitudes due to the absence of dedicated cleaners. Our results imply that cleaner fishes do not follow the pattern of main centres of origin described for reef fishes due to opportunistic cleaning behaviour that originated with higher frequency at locations with low species richness.},

Species richness presented low variation but was high at large island sites. High functional dispersion, density, and biomass were found at islands with large local species pool and distance from nearest reef. Primary productivity positively affected fish richness, density and biomass confirming that more productive areas support larger populations, and higher biomass and richness on oceanic islands. Islands densely populated by humans had lower fish species richness and biomass reflecting anthropogenic effects. Species richness, functional dispersion, and biomass were positively related to distance from the mainland. Overall, species richness and fish density were mainly influenced by biogeographical and energetic factors, whereas functional dispersion and biomass were strongly influenced by anthropogenic factors.

abstract = {A new framework for measuring functional diversity (FD) from multiple traits has recently been proposed. This framework was mostly limited to quantitative traits without missing values and to situations in which there are more species than traits, although the authors had suggested a way to extend their framework to other trait types. The main purpose of this note is to further develop this suggestion. We describe a highly flexible distance-based framework to measure different facets of FD in multidimensional trait space from any distance or dissimilarity measure, any number of traits, and from different trait types (i.e., quantitative, semi-quantitative, and qualitative). This new approach allows for missing trait values and the weighting of individual traits. We also present a new multidimensional FD index, called functional dispersion (FDis), which is closely related to Rao's quadratic entropy. FDis is the multivariate analogue of the weighted mean absolute deviation (MAD), in which the weights are species relative abundances. For unweighted presence - absence data, FDis can be used for a formal statistical test of differences in FD. We provide the "FD" R language package to easily implement our distance-based FD framework. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Ecological society of America.},

abstract = {Many ecosystems face degradation unless factors that underpin their resilience can be effectively managed. In tropical reef ecosystems, grazing by herbivorous fishes can prevent coral-macroalgal phase shifts that commonly signal loss of resilience. However, knowledge of grazing characteristics that most promote resilience is typically experimental, localized, and sparse, which limits broad management applications. Applying sound ecological theory to broad-scale data may provide an alternative basis for ecosystem management. We explore the idea that resilience is positively related to the diversity within and among functional groups of organisms. Specifically, we infer the relative vulnerability of different subregions of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to phase shifts based on functional characteristics of the local herbivorous fish communities. Reef slopes on 92 reefs set in three zones of the continental shelf in eight latitudinal sectors of the GBR were surveyed on multiple occasions between 1995 and 2009. Spatial variation in fish community structure was high and driven primarily by shelf position. Measures of functional diversity, functional redundancy, and abundance were generally higher offshore and lower inshore. Two turbid inshore subregions were considered most vulnerable based on very low measures of herbivore function, and this was supported by the occurrence of phase shifts within one of three subregions. Eleven reefs that resisted phase shifts after major coral mortality included some with very low measures of herbivore function. The fact that phase shifts did not necessarily occur when large herbivores were scarce indicates that other environmental factors compensated to preserve resilience. Estimates of vulnerability based solely on herbivore function may thus prove conservative, but caution is appropriate, since compensatory factors are largely unknown and could be eroded unwittingly by anthropogenic stresses. Our data suggest that managing the threat of phase shifts in coral reef ecosystems successfully will require spatially explicit strategies that consider both the functional characteristics of local herbivore communities and environmental factors that may raise or lower resilience thresholds. A strong positive correlation between water clarity and the species richness and abundance of herbivorous fishes suggests that management of water quality is of generic importance to ensure the ecosystem services of this important group of herbivores. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {On coral reefs, herbivorous fishes consume benthic primary producers and regulate competition between fleshy algae and reef-building corals. Many of these species are also important fishery targets, yet little is known about their global status. Using a large-scale synthesis of peer-reviewed and unpublished data, we examine variability in abundance and biomass of herbivorous reef fishes and explore evidence for fishing impacts globally and within regions. We show that biomass is more than twice as high in locations not accessible to fisheries relative to fisheries-accessible locations. Although there are large biogeographic differences in total biomass, the effects of fishing are consistent in nearly all regions. We also show that exposure to fishing alters the structure of the herbivore community by disproportionately reducing biomass of large-bodied functional groups (scraper/excavators, browsers, grazer/ detritivores), while increasing biomass and abundance of territorial algalfarming damselfishes (Pomacentridae). The browser functional group that consumes macroalgae and can help to prevent coral-macroalgal phase shifts appears to be most susceptible to fishing. This fishing down the herbivore guild probably alters the effectiveness of these fishes in regulating algal abundance on reefs. Finally, data from remote and unfished locations provide important baselines for setting management and conservation targets for this important group of fishes. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract = {Despite the important role that species names play in multiple fields, there is no globally complete list of known and described species. This lack is a result simultaneously of the complexity of planetary biodiversity, the long history of naming species in publications from all over the world, the small number of taxonomists working on many important groups, the rapid and dynamic change in knowledge for a few well-studied groups, and the limited incentives for researchers to curate such lists. Recent papers have proposed that a more formal governance mechanism is needed to assist with the translation of taxonomic knowledge to user communities. The recommendation is for the taxonomic community to assist user groups by maintaining reviewed lists that reflect as far as possible consensus among practising taxonomists and incorporating new insights and understanding as these become widely accepted within the relevant taxonomic community. The Catalogue of Life (COL) is the most significant international partnership working to deliver a list of all species by engaging a broad network of taxonomists and databases to contribute expert-curated lists for different taxonomic groups. COL, which included 1,908,823 species as of May 2021, has great experience with developing such a list across all taxonomic groups and has been modernising its processes and tools since 2017 to reflect best practice in management of large digital information assets. This paper explores the alignment between the current state and directions of COL and the initiative to improve the governance of species lists.},

abstract = {Functional diversity is increasingly identified as an important driver of ecosystem functioning. Various indices have been proposed to measure the functional diversity of a community, but there is still no consensus on which are most suitable. Indeed, none of the existing indices meets all the criteria required for general use. The main criteria are that they must be designed to deal with several traits, take into account abundances, and measure all the facets of functional diversity. Here we propose three indices to quantify each facet of functional diversity for a community with species distributed in a multidimensional functional space: functional richness (volume of the functional space occupied by the community), functional evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume), and functional divergence (divergence in the distribution of abundance in this volume). Functional richness is estimated using the existing convex hull volume index. The new functional evenness index is based on the minimum spanning tree which links all the species in the multidimensional functional space. Then this new index quantifies the regularity with which species abundances are distributed along the spanning tree. Functional divergence is measured using a novel index which quantifies how species diverge in their distances (weighted by their abundance) from the center of gravity in the functional space. We show that none of the indices meets all the criteria required for a functional diversity index, but instead we show that the set of three complementary indices meets these criteria. Through simulations of artificial data sets, we demonstrate that functional divergence and functional evenness are independent of species richness and that the three functional diversity indices are independent of each other. Overall, our study suggests that decomposition of functional diversity into its three primary components provides a meaningful framework for its quantification and for the classification of existing functional diversity indices. This decomposition has the potential to shed light on the role of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and on the influence of biotic and abiotic filters on the structure of species communities. Finally, we propose a general framework for applying these three functional diversity indices. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Reef fish represent one of the most diverse vertebrate groups on Earth, with over 7,000 species distributed around the globe. This richness is not evenly distributed geographically. The Atlantic (AT) and the Eastern Pacific (EP) encompass 30% of the global fish fauna. These areas have been considered the most isolated from the marine biodiversity hotspot in the Indo-Pacific due to distinct physical barriers, such as the Tethyan closure and the distance between the EP and the western Pacific. Despite their comparatively lower species richness, these realms host unique fish assemblages characterized by a remarkable proportion of regional endemics and species with large body size. Here, we present the largest database of life-history traits and biogeographical and conservation aspects presently available for the reef fish fauna of the AT and the EP realms. The database includes 21 traits distributed into behavioral (home range, diel activity, group size, level in the water column, three measures of preferred temperature), morphological (maximum body size, size class, body shape, aspect ratio, caudal fin, mouth position), and ecological (trophic level, diet, spawning strategy, depth of occurrence, two allometric constants, pelagic larval duration, and life span), as well as biogeographical (geographic range index, range extension, species distribution in 20 marine provinces, latitude north and south of occurrence, total number of provinces where species occur, occurrence in the AT and EP), and conservation aspects (IUCN status, vulnerability and global market price). We compiled these data through a careful review of 104 local checklists published between 1982 and 2020, online repositories, local reports, books, and monographs on specific families or genera. We limited our database to localities situated between latitudes 51°N and 45°S that including shallow and upper mesophotic biogenic and/or rocky reefs habitats. Our database covers 2,198 species belonging to 146 families and 655 reef fish genera distributed in two marine realms (1,458 in the AT, 829 in the EP, and 89 in both realms) and 20 marine provinces. This database of reef fish offers the opportunity to explore novel ecological and evolutionary questions at different scales and provides tools for species conservation based on these traits.
